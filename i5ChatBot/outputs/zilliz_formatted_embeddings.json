RELEASABILITY:  There are no releasability restrictions on this publication.   OPR:   AF/A3OWP   Supersedes:   AFH11-203V1,   1 March 1997   Certified by: AF/A3O-W  (Dr. Fred P. Lewis)  Pages: 234    This handbook familiarizes the aircrew member with fundamentals of weather. It serves as a text  for flight training programs, all USAF instrument refresher training, flight instruction programs,  and  various  unit  and  individual  flying  training  programs.  It  is  issued  to  each  instructor  and  student  involved  in  undergraduate  flight  training  programs  as  well  as  to  each  flying  unit.  This  handbook, when used with related flight directives and publications, provides weather guidance  for  visual  and  instrument  flight  under  most  circumstances.  It  is  not  a  substitute  for  sound  judgment.

This revision  reorganizes  information  into  more  appropriate  sections  of  the  document.    Several  erroneous  figures  were  removed  and  improved  illustrations  were  inserted  to  update  aircraft  inventory.   Some  sections  were  also  removed  or  edited,  as  they  were  deemed  erroneous  or  irrelevant  for  aircrews,  or  not  tractable,  and  updates  information  as  it  relates  to  weather  operations.  A  new             \f  2    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   space  weather  chapter  has  been  introduced  to  cover  impacts  to  aircraft  operations.  Finally,  several terms were changed to those more commonly used by current weather personnel.   Chapter 1\u2014THE EARTH\u2019S ATMOSPHERE     1.1.   1.2.

Introduction.  Benjamin Franklin aptly remarked: \u2015Some people are weather-wise but most  are otherwise.\u2016 He wisely understood that weather affects all facets of life. Virtually all of our  activities are affected by weather, but none is affected more than aviation. Aviation weather can  be as uneventful as a \u2015clear and a million\u2016 day or as challenging as descending through a solid  deck  of  nimbostratus  clouds  with  moderate  rime  icing  and  embedded  thunderstorms.  Aviators  can narrow the uncertainty surrounding weather  with  a well-rounded understanding of weather  processes. They can anticipate and avoid potential or existing hazardous weather conditions, and  take  advantage  of  favorable  conditions  such  as  tail  winds,  or  clearing  weather  behind  a  cold  front.   1.1.1.  This  handbook  explains  basic  meteorological  concepts  and  common  weather  problems. Aviators can use this knowledge to ask weather forecasters critical questions such  as  the  expected  movement  of  reported  severe  thunderstorms  or  the  length  of  time  the  visibility  is  to  stay  below  l/4  mile.  Perhaps  mission  planners  want  to  know  how  the  anticipated weather conditions  will affect  their sensors during Night  Vision Goggle  (NVG)  training.  What  adjustments  must  be  made  if  forecast  target  weather  is  marginal? Will  low- level  jet  stream  winds  affect  the  paratroop  drop  over  the  drop-zone  or  the  bombs\u2019  impact?  You  may  only  have  a  phone  number  to  a  remote  weather  briefing  site  to  retrieve  weather  information. Furthermore, once in the air, you may not be able to consult with a forecaster or  see  updated  weather  maps  when  confronted  with  unexpected  changes.  The  Hazardous  In- flight Weather Advisory Service (HIWAS) may not be updated. At any rate, the better  you  understand weather, the safer your flight will be.   1.2.  Composition of the Atmosphere.   1.2.1.  The  atmosphere  is  the  gaseous  envelope  covering  the  Earth  and  held  in  place  by  gravity. Comparing the Earth to a baseball, the atmosphere, in perspective, would be about as  thick as the baseball\u2019s cover. This envelope of air rotates with the Earth. The atmosphere also  has  motions  relative  to  the  Earth\u2019s  surface  called  circulations.  Circulations  are  caused  primarily by the large temperature difference between the tropics and the polar regions, with  other significant factors such as the uneven heating of land and water areas by the sun. The  atmosphere  consists  of  a  mixture  of  various  gases.  Pure,  dry  air  is  composed  of  approximately  78  percent  nitrogen,  21  percent  oxygen,  and  a  1  percent  mixture  of  other  gases, mostly argon (Figure  1.1). One of the most important  contents of the atmosphere is  water vapor, which varies in amounts from near zero to 5 percent by volume. It is present in  three physical states; a gas, a liquid, or a solid. The maximum amount of gaseous water vapor  the air can hold is temperature dependent; the higher the temperature, the more water vapor it  can  hold.  Water  vapor  remains  invisibly  suspended  in  varying  amounts  in  the  air  until,  through  condensation,  it  grows  to  sufficient  droplet  or  ice  crystal  size  to  form  clouds  or  precipitation. Even when the atmosphere is apparently clear, it contains variable amounts of  impurities,  such  as  dust,  smoke,  volcanic  ash,  and  salt  particles.  Concentrations  of  these  impurities  can  lower  visibility  resulting  in  hazy  skies  and  blurring  of  long  distance  visual  cues. The depth of the atmosphere is commonly accepted as being 300,000 feet or up to 22   \f  16    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   miles thick. Roughly half of it, by weight, lies below 18,000 feet due to gravity. This creates  a blanket of dense air near the Earth\u2019s surface upon which other forces act.   Figure 1.1.  Composition of the Atmosphere.   1.3.  The Troposphere.   1.3.1.  The  atmosphere  is  divided  into  layers,  or  spherical  shells,  each  having  certain  properties  and  characteristics.  The  upper  boundaries  of  these  layers  are  referred  to  as  \u2015pauses\u2016.  Since  most  weather  and  flying  is  in  the  troposphere  and  stratosphere,  we  will  restrict our discussions to these two layers. The troposphere is the layer closest to the Earth\u2019s  surface.  It  varies  in  depth  from  an average of 60,000 feet  over the equator to  about  30,000  feet  over  the  poles,  with  greater  depth  in  summer  than  in  winter.  Some  principal  characteristics include:   1.3.1.1.  Generally decreasing temperatures with height (Figure l.2)   1.3.1.2.  Generally increasing wind speeds with height   1.3.1.3.  Most active atmospheric phenomena called weather.   1.3.2.  At the top of the troposphere is the tropopause which serves as the boundary between  the  troposphere  and  the  stratosphere.  The  location  of  the  tropopause  is  characterized  by  a  change from a decrease in temperature with height to no change of temperature with height  (isothermal). The tropopause acts like a \u2015lid\u2016 in that it resists the exchange of air between the  troposphere  and  the  stratosphere.  This  explains  why  almost  all  water  vapor  is  found  in  the  troposphere. This also explains why the tops of thunderstorms rarely exceed the tropopause  level.  Above  the  tropopause  are  the  stratosphere,  the  mesosphere,  and  the  thermosphere  respectively  (Figure  1-2).  The  average  altitude  of  the  top  of  the  stratosphere  is  30  miles.  Characteristics of this layer are a slight increase in temperature with height (as opposed to the  decrease with height encountered in the troposphere).  Except for the near absence of water  vapor and clouds and a substantial increase in the amount of ozone, the composition of the  stratosphere is the same as the troposphere. Ozone is important because it absorbs most of the  dangerous ultraviolet rays from the sun. Aircrews flying unprotected through areas of higher  ozone  concentration  may  experience  irritation  to  eyes,  nose,  and  mouth,  or  coughing  symptoms  associated  with  ozone  sickness.  Ozone  also  has  a  corrosive  effect  on  certain  metals  and  has  become  increasingly  important  as  supersonic  aircraft  operate  in  regions  of     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     17    higher  ozone  concentration.  The  maximum  temperatures  associated  with  the  absorption  of  the sun\u2019s ultraviolet radiation occur at the stratopause.   Figure 1.2.  Troposphere--Decrease in Temperature with Height.   1.4.  Aircrew Environment.   1.4.1.  Because  the  atmosphere  contains  21  percent  oxygen,  the  pressure  oxygen  exerts  is  about  one-fifth  of  the  total  air  pressure  at  any  given  level.  This  is  important  to  aircrews  because the  rate at  which the lungs absorb oxygen depends upon the oxygen pressure. The  average person is accustomed to absorbing oxygen at a pressure of 3 pounds per square inch  (psi).  Since  air  pressure  decreases  with  increasing  altitude,  atmospheric  pressure  also  decreases.  Prolonged  high  altitude  flight  without  supplemental  oxygen  results  in  hypoxia  starting  with  a  feeling  of  exhaustion,  then  vision  impairment,  and  finally  unconsciousness.  Since the first effects of hypoxia can occur without the person realizing it, auxiliary oxygen  must be used during prolonged flights above 10,000 feet, or when flying above 12,000 feet  for  even  short  periods  of  time.  When  the  atmospheric  pressure  falls  below  3  pounds  per  square inch (approximately 10,000 feet), a system of environmental pressurization becomes  essential.     \f  18    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Chapter 2   MOISTURE   2.1.  Introduction.  Water  covers  around  two-thirds  of  the  Earth\u2019s  surface.  It  is  in  a  constant  state of transformation, where the three most important stages are evaporation, condensation, and  precipitation.  This  continuous  process  is  called  the  hydrologic  cycle  (Figure  2.1).  It  keeps  the  atmosphere supplied with moisture and helps produce temperature and pressure changes . Most  of the atmosphere\u2019s moisture is concentrated in the troposphere, and is rarely found in significant  amounts above the tropopause. The remaining third of the Earth\u2019s surface is land with elevation  contrasts  and  vegetation  differences.  A  good  working  knowledge  of  local  and  regional  terrain  variations  is  important  to  understanding  local  weather  effects.  Terrain  varies  from  sharply  contrasting  mountain  ranges  to  vast  stretches  of  flat  plains  and  plateaus.  Each  type  of  terrain  significantly influences low level wind flow, moisture availability, and temperature. The weather  can be cloudy and rainy on the windward side of a mountain range and cloudless and dry on the  leeward  side.  Knowledge  of  terrain  features  can  help  you  anticipate  likely  precipitation  areas  characterized by instrument  flight  rules  (IFR) conditions,  as  well as areas  of visual  flight  rules  (VFR) conditions.   Figure 2.1.  Hydrologic Cycle.   2.2.  Changes of State.     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     19    2.2.1.  Water in the atmosphere exists in three states: vapor, liquid, and solid. Water vapor is  water in the gaseous state and is not visible. In the liquid state, it forms as rain, drizzle, fog,  and as small water droplets which form clouds. In its solid state, it forms as snow, hail, ice  pellets, ice-crystal clouds, and ice-crystal fog.   2.2.2.  The oceans serve as the primary source of water vapor for the atmosphere. To a lesser  extent, moisture sources also include lakes, rivers, swamps, moist soil, snow, ice fields, and  vegetation.  As  moisture  evaporates  into  its  vapor  state,  the  wind  may  carry  moisture  great  distances before it changes states into liquid or solid precipitation.   2.2.3.  Evaporation,  condensation,  sublimation,  and  deposition  are  changes  of  state.  When  water changes from a liquid to a gas, molecules escape from the liquid\u2019s surface and enter the  air  as  water  vapor.  Evaporation  rate  increases  with  temperature.  This  is  a  simplified  explanation  of  evaporation.  Condensation  is  the  change  of  state  from  a  gas  to  a  liquid.  Condensation  takes  place when a volume of  air  reaches  its saturation point. Sublimation  is  the change of state directly from a solid to a gas. The reverse is called deposition which is the  change  directly  from  a  gas  to  a  solid.  Two  other  familiar  changes  of  state  are  melting  and  freezing.   2.2.4.  Any  change  of  state  involves  heat  exchange  where  energy  is  absorbed  or  released.  Figure  2-2  illustrates  the  heat  exchanges  between  the  different  states  of  water.  During  evaporation,  escaping  water  molecules  absorb  energy  (heat)  to  break  away  from  the  attraction of the other molecules. This cools the remaining liquid since it has less heat. Heat  required for evaporation is not lost, but remains hidden or latent in the water vapor. When the  vapor  condenses  to  liquid  water  or  deposits  directly  to  ice,  this  heat  is  released  to  the  atmosphere  and  the  surrounding  air  becomes  warmer.  As  an  example,  the  amount  of  heat  given off in  a thunderstorm  during the process  of precipitating one-half inch of rain  over a  square mile is over 71 trillion Joules. The energy released by the atomic bomb dropped on  Hiroshima was almost  84 trillion  Joules. Melting, freezing, and sublimation all involve the  exchange of heat in a similar manner.   2.2.5.  The capacity for a parcel of air to hold water vapor is related to the temperature, where  as  temperature  is  a  measure  of  energy.    Therefore,  the  warmer  the  air,  the  more  energy  is  available for evaporation or sublimation. The cooler the air, the less energy is available for  condensation  or  deposition,  until  the  saturation  point  is  reached  and  water  droplets  or  ice  crystals  grow  to  the  point  they  form  visible  clouds.    According  to  Charles\u2019  Law,  when  pressure is held constant, as temperature increases, so does the volume of air (Figure 2.3). In  this  case  the  warmer  the  air,  the  more  water  vapor  it  can  hold  before  reaching  saturation  when the water condenses. For approximately every 20oF (11oC) increase in temperature, the  capacity of a volume of air to hold water vapor doubles. Conversely, as a parcel  cools, the  temperature  and  dew  point  temperature  eventually  equalize,  and  the  relative  humidity  becomes 100%. Further cooling allows some water vapor to visibly condense as fog, clouds,  or precipitation. The relative humidity and dew point concepts are expanded during the next  few paragraphs.   \f  20    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 2.2.  Phase Transitions of Water.   2.3.  Relative Humidity.   2.3.1.  Relative humidity is  the ratio of the actual  water vapor in  the air to the water vapor  that the air would contain if saturated. When a given air sample contains all the water vapor  possible at a given temperature, the relative humidity is 100 percent (Figure 2.3). A relative  humidity  value  of  50  percent  means  the  air  contains  half  the  water  vapor  it  is  capable  of  holding at that temperature. Practically speaking, on a cold day with a temperature of 35\u00b0F  and a dew point of 30\u00b0F, the relative humidity is 84 percent. On a hot day with a temperature  of 95\u00b0F and the same dew point of 30oF, the relative humidity is only 10 percent. The dew  point temperature is the same, but the relative humidity is quite different. If on the same hot  day the temperature was 95F with a dew point of 74F, the relative humidity will feel high but  in actuality is only 50%!     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     21    Figure 2.3.  Relative Humidity and Dew point.   2.4.  Dew Point, Dew and Frost.   2.4.1.  The  dew  point  is  the  temperature  to  which  a  volume  of  air  at  constant  atmospheric  pressure  must  be  cooled  to  become  saturated,  i.e.,  reach  100%  humidity.  When  this  temperature is below freezing, it is sometimes called the frost point. The difference between  the actual air temperature and the dew point temperature is an indication of how close the air  is  to  becoming  saturated.  This  temperature  difference  is  commonly  called  the  dew  point  depression.  Relative  humidity  increases  as  the  dew  point  depression  decreases.    When  the  relative  humidity  becomes  100%,  the  dew  point  depression  is  zero.  Weather  observations  regularly include the dew point. Be alert for fog or low cloud formation any time the surface  air temperature is within 4oF of the dew point, and the spread between the two is decreasing.  Generally this condition is optimal during late night and early morning hours. On the other  hand, when the difference between the two temperatures is increasing, existing fog and low  clouds will likely dissipate because water vapor is evaporating into the warming air. This is  often true in the morning hours, when air temperature is increasing as the day progresses. Be  aware,  however,  that  fog  and  low  clouds  may  form  2  to  3  hours  after  sunrise  if  there  is  a  layer of moist air in the first few hundred feet above the surface.   2.4.2.  During  clear,  still  nights,  aircraft  surfaces  often  cool  by  radiation  to  a  temperature  equal to the dew point of the surrounding air. The moisture or dew collects on the airframe  surface just as it does on a pitcher of ice water in a warm room. The moisture comes from the  air in  direct  contact  with  the cool  surface.  Frost forms  when the temperature is  colder than  the melting or freezing point of water. Water vapor then deposits directly as ice crystals or  frost rather than condensing as dew. Sometimes dew forms and later freezes, but frozen dew  is easily distinguishable from frost since it is transparent and frost is opaque. Aircrews should  not underestimate the dangers associated with frost formation. When frost forms on airframes  it  results  in  increased  drag  and  decreased  lift.    This  will  be  covered  more  thoroughly  in"

Condensation occurs if moisture is added to a volume of air after saturation has been  reached or if cooling of the air reduces the temperature to or below the saturation point.  As  shown in Figure 2.4, the most frequent cause of condensation is cooling of the air resulting  when: (a) air moves over a colder surface, (b) air is lifted and cools by expansion, or (c) air  near the ground is cooled at night as a result of radiational cooling.   2.5.2.  Evaporation  is  the  change  of  state  from  liquid  to  a  gas.    Some  common  causes  of  evaporation are advection (transport) of dry air into a cloud and compressional warming due  to subsidence (sinking air) that increase the dewpoint depression in a volume of air.   Figure 2.4.  Causes of Condensation.   2.6.  Clouds and Fog.   2.6.1.  Clouds and fog form in air that has become saturated with respect  to liquid water or  crystalline  ice.  Clouds  and  fog  are  composed  of  very  small  droplets  of  water  or  ice  which  collect  on  microscopic  water-absorbent  particles  called  condensation  nuclei  (water)  or  deposition  nuclei  (ice).  These  aerosols  include  sea  salts,  dust,  industrial  pollution  particles,  volcanic  ash,  and  a  variety  of  other  sources.  They  are  so  small  their  size  is  measured  in  microns  (millionths  of  a  meter).  Clouds  generally  form  when  the  air  becomes  saturated.  Clouds and fog which form at temperatures well below freezing (-20o C or lower) are usually  composed  of  ice  crystals,  which  form  directly  from  water  vapor  through  the  deposition  process.  However,  liquid  water  droplets  are  frequently  observed  in  the  atmosphere  at  temperatures much lower than the freezing point, and have been observed at  -40o C. These  supercooled water droplets are prevalent in clouds to a temperature of about -20oC. Aircraft  flying  through  supercooled  clouds  will  likely  encounter  icing  as  the  impact  of  the  aircraft  induces freezing of the supercooled droplets upon contact.   2.7.  Precipitation.   2.7.1.  Precipitation is liquid or solid moisture that falls from the atmosphere as rain, freezing  rain, drizzle, freezing drizzle, ice pellets, snow, hail, or a combination of these. As shown in  Figure 2.5, the type of precipitation is largely dependent upon air temperature and the degree  of  turbulence  present.  Precipitation  often  begins  as  suspended  ice  crystals  grow  through  collisions with other ice crystals while traveling through moving air currents within a cloud.  The growing ice crystals eventually attain a fall-speed which exceeds the upward air current  velocity. As the ice crystals fall through the freezing point into warmer air they begin to melt     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     23    and, when melted completely, form raindrops. They continue to collide with other raindrops  and grow larger.   Figure 2.5.  Precipitation Products.   2.7.2.  In  clouds  with  no  freezing  level  and  the  presence  of  minute  droplets,  collision  and  coalescence  of  variable  sized  water  droplets  produces  liquid  precipitation.  Vertical  air  currents  cause  the  droplets  to  collide  and  assist  in  the  growth  of  clouds  by  carrying  water  droplets to higher altitudes. Gentle ascending air currents will produce light precipitation and  thinner clouds. Turbulent air currents produce heavier precipitation with larger droplet sizes  and  clouds  more  than  4,000  feet  thick.  Usually  precipitation  of  light  intensity  falls  from  stable stratus type clouds less than 4,000 feet thick. Precipitation can change its state as its  environmental  temperature  varies.  For  example,  during  the  winter,  descending  snow  can  change  to  rain  as  the  precipitation  goes  through  warmer  layers  of  air,  and  the  rain  can  descend  further  into  colder  air  (below  freezing  point)  refreezing  into  ice  pellets  before  reaching  the  ground.  This  situation  can  happen  frequently  in  the  vicinity  of  warm  fronts  during the winter when an aircraft can cross the freezing level several times while ascending  or descending.   2.7.3.  Not all precipitation reaches the Earth. Sometimes it evaporates completely in dry air  beneath the cloud base. This phenomenon is known as \u2015virga\u2016 and is a common occurrence  in  hot,  dry  areas  such  as  the  western  United  States  and  Southwest  Asia.  Virga  appears  as  wisps or streaks of liquid water attached to the bottom of a cloud but not reaching the surface  (Figure  2.6).  Virga  composed  exclusively  of  ice  crystals  is  known  as  \u2015fallstreaks\u2016.  The  evaporation  process  cools  the  air.  This  cooler,  denser  air  sinks  creating  a  downdraft.  If  the  virga reaches the ground, it\u2019s reported as precipitation. If a large volume of virga evaporates     \f  24    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   rapidly, it can form a downburst or microburst.  Microbursts are downdrafts concentrated in  an area of less than 2.5 miles in diameter that are dangerous to aircraft taking off or landing  because they dramatically increase wind shear and increase or decrease air speed and lift.   Figure 2.6.  Virga.     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     25    Chapter 3   TEMPERATURE   3.1.  Introduction.  Temperature  is  important  to  the  aircrew  because  it  enters  into  the  computation  of  most  aircraft  performance  parameters.  Aircrews  can  use  the  information  to  determine  load  capacities  and  takeoff  roll  information.  During  hot  weather  conditions  some  aircraft  cannot  take  off  until  the  temperature  and  pressure  altitude  conditions  become  more  favorable.  This  chapter  relates  heat  and  temperature,  describes  commonly  used  temperature  scales, and surveys temperature variations both at the surface and aloft.   3.2.  Measuring Temperature.   3.2.1.  Temperature is a measurement of heat energy and describes the degree of molecular  activity. Since different substances have different molecular structures, equal amounts of heat  applied to two different objects of equal mass usually results in one object getting hotter than  the  other.  For  example,  a  land  surface  becomes  hotter  than  a  water  surface  when  equal  amounts  of  heat  are  added  to  each.    In  Figure  3.1,  Q*  indicates  the  heat  which  becomes  sensible  or  measurable  heat  on  land  but  in  water  becomes  latent  or  stored  heat.  The  sun\u2019s  radiation  unevenly  heats  the  Earth\u2019s  surface  during  the  day,  creating  temperature  and  pressure differences that ultimately drive the Earth\u2019s weather.   Figure 3.1.  Land has Greater Temperature Variance than Water.   3.3.  Temperature Scales.   3.3.1.  Fahrenheit and Celsius (centigrade) are the names given to the two temperature scales  important  to  the  aircrew  member.  On  the  Fahrenheit  (F)  scale,  the  freezing  point  is  at  32  degrees and the boiling point at 212 degrees --a difference of 180 degrees (Figure  3.2). On  the Celsius (C) scale, the freezing point is at 0 degrees and the boiling point at 100 degrees -- a difference of 100 degrees. The ratio between degrees F and degrees Celsius is, therefore,     \f  26    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   180 to 100, or 9 to 5. This means that a temperature difference of 9 degrees F is equal to a  difference of 5 degrees C. This ratio is used in converting from one scale to another as shown  in  Figure  3.2  The  measurement  of  outside  air  temperatures  with  the  typical  aircraft  thermometer is influenced by several factors (such as radiation, air compression, and friction)  which  tend  to  decrease  the  accuracy  of  these  observations.  Such  effects  may  cause  the  reading to differ from the true free-air temperature by 25 degrees F (14 degrees C) or more,  except  where  careful  engineering  has  been  provided.  Most  flight  manuals  contain  a  temperature correction chart to obtain true air temperature.   Figure 3.2.  Temperature Scales.   3.4.  Diurnal Cycle.   3.4.1.  Diurnal variation is the daily change in temperature from day to night. During the day,  incoming  solar  radiation  exceeds  outgoing  terrestrial  radiation  and  the  surface  becomes  warmer. The daily temperature maximum usually lags behind the maximum solar insolation,  occurring  during  the  mid-afternoon  hours.  At  night,  solar  radiation  ceases,  but  longwave  terrestrial radiation continues to emanate upward from the Earth\u2019s surface, causing it to cool.  The same temperature lag process explains why the minimum temperature usually occurs just  after sunrise. The continued nighttime cooling process lags a bit even after sunrise and is one  reason fog can form  shortly after sunrise. The range of temperature between night  and day  varies considerably, both with season and location. This daily variation ranges as much as 30  to  50  degrees  Fahrenheit  in  arid  areas  to  15  to  20  degrees  Fahrenheit  in  most  mid-latitude  locations.  It is greater near the surface of barren high-level areas, over sand, plowed fields,  and rocks.  It  is  much smaller over thick vegetation and deep water surfaces.  Practically no  daily temperature change occurs in  the free air  4,000 feet  or more above the surface in  the     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     27    troposphere.  The  daytime  vertical  temperature  mixing  process  rarely  extends  above  4,000  feet above ground level (AGL).   3.4.2.  Aircrew Note.   3.4.2.1.  The  temperature  (and  resultant  air  density)  at  and  near  the  surface  greatly  affects aircraft allowable gross weights for both takeoff and landing. An aircraft taking  off during night or early morning in cooler, denser air has more allowable gross weight  (all other factors being equal) than it would have in the early afternoon when the air is  warmed and becomes less dense.   3.5.  Land/Sea Difference.   3.5.1.  The temperature distribution over the Earth\u2019s surface largely depends on the seasons  and  on  the  composition  and  distribution  of  land/sea  surfaces.  Figure  3.3  and  Figure  3.4shows the surface temperature distribution for January and July in both hemispheres and  clearly  illustrates  the  influence  of  topography  on  the  temperature.  The  following  pertinent  information can be noted:   3.5.1.1.  Ocean  areas  between  latitudes  40  degrees  N  and  S  show  little  temperature  change from summer to winter.   3.5.1.2.  Land areas are warmer than the adjacent water areas at the same latitude during  summer.   3.5.1.3.  Water areas are warmer than the adjacent land areas at the same latitude during  winter.   3.5.1.4.  Both the warmest and coldest temperatures are found over the land areas.   \f  28    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 3.3.

Temperature normally decreases with increasing altitude throughout the troposphere.  This decrease of temperature with altitude is called the lapse rate, expressed in degrees per  thousand feet. The standard lapse rate in the troposphere is 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) per  1,000  feet.  This  value  serves  as  the  basis  for  calibrating  aircraft  instruments  and  preparing  performance  charts.  Figure  3.5  is  a  plot  of  the  vertical  profile  of  temperature  (red  line),  dewpoint (green line), and pressure (horizontal black lines) at a point location. Variation in  the lapse rate may change with altitude. At a given time and place, the vertical temperature  might decrease at a rate of 3\u00baC per 1,000 ft from the ground to an altitude of 5,000 ft, at a rate  of 1\u00baC per 1,000 ft between 5,000 and 7,000 ft, and at 2\u00baC per 1,000 ft above 7,000 ft until  the  tropopause  is  reached.  Rarely  does  the  temperature  decrease  at  an  orderly  rate.  In  fact,  temperature  inversions  are  common  in  the  troposphere,  where  temperature  increases  with  height.  Notice the relatively deep inversion from 1000 mb to 900 mb in Figure 3-4, with a  smaller one between 750 mb and 725 mb.     \f  30    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 3.5.  Lapse Rate Temperature Reversals are Called Inversions.   3.7.  Inversions.   3.7.1.  When a layer within the troposphere increases in temperature with altitude it is called  an inversion, because the usual decrease in temperature with altitude is inverted. Inversions  are usually confined to a relatively shallow layer several hundred feet thick but can be up to a  few thousand feet in depth. The three main types of inversions are the radiation, subsidence  and  frontal.  The  most  common  inversion  over  land,  the  radiation  or  nocturnal  inversion,  is  produced immediately  above the  ground on  clear, relatively  still nights.  Since air is a poor  conductor,  the  ground  loses  heat  rapidly  through  terrestrial  radiation,  cooling  the  layer  and  creating a temperature inversion. The coldest air is often adjacent to the Earth\u2019s surface with  the  amount  of  cooling  decreasing  rapidly  with  altitude,  which  causes  the  temperature  to  increase  up  to  some  elevation.  The  air  temperature  a  thousand  feet  above  the  ground  is  affected very little or not at all. Terrestrial radiation thus causes the lowest layer of air to be  colder than the air just above that layer. If skies are overcast, nighttime cooling is reduced,  thus  reducing  the  likelihood  of  a  radiation  inversion  forming.  Inversions  are  also  found  in  association with movement of colder air under warm air or the movement of warm air over  cold  air.  Such  inversions  are  often  called  frontal  inversions.  Their  formation  will  be  discussed  in  the  chapter  on  fronts.  A  subsidence  inversion  sometimes  forms  as  a  result  of  widespread  sinking  of  air  (subsidence)  within  a  relatively  thick  layer  aloft,  while  the  air  below this layer is  essentially unchanged. This sinking air is heated by compression, and it  may become warmer than the air below it. Subsidence inversions are commonly encountered     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     31    in  areas  affected  by  high  pressure.  Sometimes  an  aircraft  will  encounter  more  than  one  subsidence inversion.  Figure  3.5  (above) illustrates a ground (surface-based) inversion  and  an inversion aloft.   3.7.2.  Aircrew Note.   3.7.2.1.  Restrictions to vision, such as fog, haze, smoke, and low clouds, are often found  in or below low inversions and in layers through which there is only a small change in  temperature.  The  air  in  these  layers  is  usually  very  smooth;  however,  light  turbulence  may be expected when flying through inversion flight levels.   3.7.2.2.  Inversions  often  form  the  boundary  between  altitudes  of  widely  varying  wind  speeds and directions. In the Midwest, a summertime radiation inversion often divides the  light and variable surface winds from the low level jet winds. The wind speed difference  can  be  40  knots  within  a  few  hundred  feet,  causing  wind  shear  and  turbulence  in  the  lower levels.  The low level  radiation inversion and associated wind  shear/turbulence is  most common in the lowest 2,000 feet of the atmosphere.   \f  32    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Chapter 4   ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE AND ALTIMETRY   4.1.  Introduction.  Atmospheric pressure is one of the most important weather parameters that  aviators need to understand. Aviators need to know the differences between the altimeter setting,  sea level pressure, pressure altitude, density altitude, and constant pressure values. All of these  different  pressure variables impact  aviators in  significantly different  ways.  A \u2015QNH\u2016  altimeter  setting  used  by  most  countries  represents  a  pressure  reading  quite  different  than  a  \u2015QFE\u2016  pressure  reading  used  by  a  few.  The  following  sections  will  discuss  the  important  pressure  concepts and their impact upon flying operations.   4.2.  Atmospheric Pressure.   4.2.1.  Atmospheric pressure is the force-per-unit area exerted by the weight of a column of  air  extending  directly  above  a  given  fixed  point.  As  a  result  of  constant  and  complex  air  movements  and  changes  in  air  mass  characteristics,  the  weight  of  this  air  column  is  continually fluctuating. These changes in air weight, and therefore air pressure, are measured  with pressure-sensitive instruments called barometers. Most military weather stations use two  barometers for barometric pressure readings.   4.2.2.  Barometric pressure is expressed in many ways throughout the world. The three most  common units are inches of mercury (Hg), millibars (mb), and hectopascals (hPa). Since the  Kollsman window of altimeters in United States aircraft is calibrated for settings in inches of  mercury,  United  States  military  and  civil  weather  agencies  express  altimeter  settings  in  inches of mercury. Many foreign nations use millibar for altimeter settings. Crew members  flying  in  these  countries  can  consult  the  Flight  Information  Handbook,  Conversion  Tables,  Section  D,  for  a  table  of  millibars  to  inches  of  mercury  and  vice  versa.  The  standard  atmospheric  pressure  at  sea  level  is  1013.25  mb,  which  corresponds  to  29.92  inches  of  mercury.   4.2.3.  Some  civilian  weather  stations,  both  domestic  and  overseas,  still  use  the  mercurial  barometer.  Air  Force  crew  members  should  be  familiar  with  all  three  barometric  pressure  instruments.  The  mercurial  barometer,  shown  in  Figure  4.1,  consists  of  an  open  dish  of  mercury  into  which  is  placed  the  open  end  of  an  evacuated  glass  tube.  Mercury  is  used  because it is one of the heaviest liquids at normal temperatures. The mercury barometer was  used  as  the  standard  for  deriving  pressure  readings  for  many  years  and  is  still  used  as  the  measuring  standard  at  many  civilian  overseas  locations.  Atmospheric  pressure  forces  mercury to rise in the tube. In an ideal or standardized atmosphere at sea level, a column of  mercury  rises  to  a  height  of  29.92  inches  or  760  millimeters.  In  other  words,  a  column  of  mercury  measuring  29.92  inches  represents  the  weight  of  a  column  of  air  having  the  same  cross  section  as  the  column  of  mercury  and  extending  from  sea  level  to  the  top  of  the  atmosphere.  The  change  in  mercury  height  measures  differences  in  air  pressure  at  that  location.   \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     33    Figure 4.1.  Normal Atmospheric Pressure at Sea Level.   4.2.4.  The  necessity  for  a  more  convenient  and  sturdy  pressure  instrument  resulted  in  the  Aneroid  Barometer.  This  barometer  doesn\u2019t  use  fluid  to  measure  pressure.  Instead  the  internal  workings has  a  cell made of thin metal  to  make it flexible, operating in  a partially  evacuated  environment  so  it  responds  more  readily  to  changes  in  atmospheric  pressure  (Figure 4.2). One end of the cell is fixed, while the other end is coupled to a pointer on a dial  marked with pressure readings expressed in feet. The coupling itself magnifies the movement  of the free end of the cell so as to express its calibration of 1,000 feet of altitude to each one  inch of barometric pressure change. This approximates the rate of pressure change found in  the lowest 10,000 feet of the atmosphere.   Figure 4.2.  Aneroid Barometer Inner View.   4.2.5.  Most  military  and  all  fixed  Air  Force  Weather  observing  sites  use  some  form  of  automated observing system.  The system continuously displays the altimeter setting and can  display station pressure when needed. It digitally displays pressure readings in either inches  or millibars.       \f  34    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   4.3.  Pressure Distribution.   4.3.1.  When  the  pressure  is  measured  at  an  airport,  it  is  the  weight  of  the  air  above  the  airport  that  is  measured.  This  is  called  station  pressure.  Pressure  usually  decreases  with  height so the pressure at a high elevation will be less than pressure at a lower elevation. To  analyze weather maps, the pressure at different observing stations must be compared. Since  station  pressure  varies  with  the  station  elevation,  all  station  pressures  must  be  adjusted  to  some common level to make the comparison (Figure 4.3). The commonly reduced level used  is Mean Sea Level (MSL).   Figure 4.3.  Larger Air Column = Higher Station pressure (assuming a standard  atmosphere).   4.4.  Pressure Correction.   4.4.1.  The biggest change in barometric pressure comes with height. Within the lowest few  thousand feet  of the troposphere, where most of  the atmosphere is  concentrated because of  gravity, the change amounts roughly to 1 inch of mercury for each 1,000 feet of altitude. In  Figure 4.3 (above), we illustrate this concept by using two reported barometric pressures at  Denver  and  New  Orleans  in  an  assumed  standard  atmosphere.  The  observer  at  Denver,  located at 5,000 feet above sea level, will read approximately 24.92 inches on the barometer.  The observer at New Orleans will read approximately 29.92 inches. Since all stations are not  at  the  same  elevation  and  conditions  (e.g.,  densities)  vary,  the  observed  station  pressure  is  adjusted to mean sea level pressure (MSL) for pressure reporting purposes. If this correction  was not applied, Denver would almost always report a lower barometric pressure than New  Orleans.  Pressure  variations  are  continually  occurring  at  any  given  location  at  any  given  time.  There  are  diurnal,  seasonal,  frontal,  and  occasional  abrupt  pressure  changes.  Abrupt  changes  occur  due  to  frontal  passages,  thunderstorms,  and  the  movement  of  high  and  low  pressure  systems.  Passages  of  well-developed  pressure  systems  (either  highs  or  lows)  are  often accompanied by a large change in pressure with the  changes occurring over a several  hour  period.  The  more  gradual  variations  occur  on  a  weekly,  monthly,  and  seasonal  basis.     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     35    But  pressure  varies  most  with  vertical  altitude  changes  and  corresponding  air  temperature  changes.   4.5.  Temperature Effects on Pressure.   4.5.1.  Air expands as it becomes warmer and contracts as it cools.  Figure  4.4 shows three  columns of air--one colder than standard temperature, one at standard temperature, and one  warmer than standard temperature. Air pressure is equal at the bottom of each column and at  the  top  of  each  column,  but  the  volume  of  each  air  column  differs  with  respect  to  temperature.  Vertical  expansion  of  the  warm  column  makes  it  higher  than  the  column  at  standard  temperature.  Contraction  of  the  cold  column  makes  it  shorter.  Since  pressure  decrease is the same in each column, the rate of decrease of pressure with height in warm air  is less than standard. The rate of decrease of pressure with height in cold air is greater than  standard.  Atmospheric  pressure  readings  are  used  quite  extensively  by  meteorologists  and  aircrew  members  alike.  Analyzed  weather  chart  pressure  patterns  give  insight  to  observed  weather and forecast weather changes.   Figure 4.4.  Pressure Rate Decrease with Height Varies with Temperature.   4.6.  Pressure Maps.   4.6.1.  There are numerous pressure patterns that aircrews can learn to recognize on weather  charts  because  they  frequently  happen  and  are  associated  with  numerous  flying  hazards.  There is a direct relationship between pressure systems and air flow (wind). In general, high  pressure  areas  are  typically  regions  of  favorable  weather  conditions,  while  lows  are  often  associated with bad weather.   4.6.2.  To  provide  a  visual  portrayal  of  the  pressure  patterns  across  the  country,  the  MSL  pressures from the observing stations are plotted on a surface weather map. Lines connecting  stations of equal pressure are called isobars (expressed in millibars). They are usually drawn  at  4  millibar  (mb)  intervals.  These  isobars  form  a  pressure  \u2015topographic\u2016  map.  In  many  cases,  isobaric  patterns  yield  clues  to  possible  weather  conditions.  Lower  pressure  values  usually  indicate  bad  weather  while  high  pressure  typically  indicates  good  weather  (Figure  4.5). Tightly compacted isobars indicate quickly changing weather and strong winds. Loosely  aligned isobars indicate light winds and generally fair or static weather conditions. On Figure     \f  36    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   4-5,  notice  the  high  pressure  values  and  weak  pressure  gradient  over  Texas.    This  area  is  likely  to  experience  clear  skies  and  light  winds.    Comparatively,  notice  the  low  pressure  values and tight pressure gradient over upstate New York.  This area is likely to experience  worse weather conditions with a greater potential for flying hazards.   Figure 4.5.  Surface Pressure Chart.   4.6.3.  Above the Earth\u2019s surface, the convention is to use constant pressure charts, with lines  called  contours depicting the varying height  of  standard  atmospheric pressure levels.  Thus,  contours  are  lines  of  equal  altitude  (Figure  4.6)  and  are  expressed  in  meters.  Analyzed  contour patterns can indicate the relative strength of upper level winds much the same as the  isobars on the surface weather map. The tighter the contour, the stronger the winds because  rapid change in atmospheric pressure heights are correlated with increased winds. Common  surface pressure and upper air chart symbols are explained below:   4.6.3.1.  Low--An  area  of  low  pressure  surrounded  on  all  sides  by  higher  pressure  (as  outlined by isobars on surface charts) or an area of low true altitude surrounded by higher  true altitudes (as shown by contours on upper air charts): also called a cyclone."

Pressure  variations  also  affect  the  atmosphere\u2019s  density,  and  therefore  they  affect flight. The most noticeable effects of decreased pressure due to increased elevation  are  higher  required  true  air  speed  for  takeoffs  and  landings,  increased  takeoff  and  landing distances, decreased rate of climb, and stalls at increased true air speeds.   4.7.  Standard Atmosphere.     \f  38    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   4.7.1.  Since the vertical distribution of both temperature and pressure changes with time and  place, some convenient vertical structure of the atmosphere, representing average conditions,  had  to  be  assumed  to  obtain  fixed  reference  points.  The  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO)  determined  a  year-round  average  of  pressure/height/temperature  soundings that is now considered the standard atmosphere for use in calibrating the aneroid  barometer.   4.7.1.1.  Here is a partial list of conditions assigned by ICAO that make up the standard  atmosphere:   4.7.1.1.1.  A surface temperature of l5\u00b0C (59\u00b0F) at sea level.   4.7.1.1.2.  A  surface  pressure  of  29.92  inches  of  mercury  (1013.2  millibars,  14.7  pounds per square inch) at sea level.   4.7.1.1.3.  A lapse rate within the troposphere of approximately 2\u00b0C per 1,000 feet up  to the tropopause.   4.7.1.1.4.  A tropopause at approximately 36,000 feet.   4.7.1.1.5.  A lapse rate of 0\u00b0C in the stratosphere to approximately 82,000 feet.   4.7.2.  The advent of aviation early in the last century brought about a search for an accurate  method  of  measuring  the  altitude  at  which  an  aircraft  was  flying.  Barometric  pressure  was  ideal for several reasons, chiefly the fact that pressure change with altitude is approximately  10,000 times greater than that found in equivalent horizontal distances. The rate of change in  vertical heights in the lower atmosphere is about 1 inch for every 1,000 feet of altitude. An  aircraft  altimeter  (Figure  4.7)  is  essentially  an  aneroid  barometer  calibrated  to  indicate  altitude  in  feet  instead  of  pressure.  This  altitude  is  independent  of  the  terrain  below.  An  altimeter  reads  accurately  only  in  a  standard  atmosphere  and  when  properly  adjusted  altimeter  settings  are  used.  Remember,  an  altimeter  is  only  a  pressure-measuring  device.  It  indicates  10,000  feet  with  29.92  set  in  the  Kollsman  window,  and  the  pressure  is  697  millibars, whether or not the altitude is actually 10,000 feet.   Figure 4.7.  Aneroid Altimeter.   4.7.3.  The  effect  is  important  since  in  the  lowest  15,000  feet  of  the  atmosphere  a  2-3oC  deviation of the mean temperature from the standard temperature of 2.8oC will cause about a  1% percent error in the altimeter reading. For example, if an aircraft with a correct altimeter     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     39    setting is flying at an indicated altitude of 10,000 feet but the air below flight level is 11\u00b0C  warmer than the standard atmosphere temperature of 2.8\u00b0C, the altimeter will read about  4  percent too low. The aircraft will be flying at a true altitude of 10,400 feet (400 feet higher  than  indicated).  Carefully  study  Figure  4.8  to  visually  see  the  effects  of  temperature  on  aircraft indicated and true altitudes.   Figure 4.8.  Effects of Temperature on True and Indicated Altitude.   4.8.  Pressure Altitude.   4.8.1.  In the standard atmosphere, sea level pressure is 29.92 inches Hg or 1013.2 millibars.  This  is  called  the  standard  datum  plane.  Pressure  falls  at  a  fixed  rate  upward  through  this  hypothetical  atmosphere.  Pressure  altitude  is  the  altitude  above  that  standard  datum  plane.  Therefore,  crew  members  can  easily  determine  pressure  altitude  from  the  aircraft  altimeter  whether in flight or on the ground. Simply set the altimeter to the standard altimeter setting  of  29.92  inches,  and  the  altimeter  will  indicate  pressure  altitude.  Block  7  of  the  Flight  Weather  Briefing,  DD  Form  175-1,  is  for  pressure  altitude  calculations  furnished  by  AF  Weather personnel.   4.9.  Density Altitude.   4.9.1.  Density  altitude  is  pressure  altitude  corrected  for  nonstandard  temperature.  Since  standard atmospheric conditions are seldom encountered, the density altitude for an airfield  may vary several thousand feet from the actual mean sea level elevation of the field. On a hot  day, the air becomes \u2015thinner,\u2016 and its density at the field is equivalent to a higher altitude in  the standard atmosphere. The field then has a high (+) density altitude. An example of this  would be  a  field  located 5,000 feet  above mean  sea level  with  a density  altitude of 10,000  feet.  An  aircraft  flying  at  this  field  would  then  be  operating  in  air  normally  found  in  the  standard  atmosphere  at  10,000  feet.  Conversely,  on  a  cold  day  the  air  becomes  heavy.  Its  density  is  the  same  as  that  at  an  altitude  in  the  standard  atmosphere  lower  than  the  field  elevation. The density altitude is then lower (-) than normal.     \f  40    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   4.9.2.  The efficiency of aircraft performance is  greatly  affected by the varying densities of  the  atmosphere.  Low  density  altitude  increases  aircraft  performance.  High  density  altitude,  however,  can  be  a  hazard  since  it  reduces  aircraft  performance,  especially  if  the  aircraft  is  critically loaded. The lift of the wing or blade is affected by the speed of the air around it and  the  density  of  the  air  through  which  it  moves.  In  areas  of  high  density  altitude,  additional  engine  power  is  required  to  compensate  for  the  thin  air.  Takeoff  and  landing  rolls  are  lengthened, and rates of climb and service ceiling are reduced. Density altitude can also be  determined by using a dead reckoning (DR) computer or a conversion chart found in aircraft  T.O.\u2019s. If you know the ambient temperature and the pressure altitude, you can use a simple  conversion  chart  to  find  the  density  altitude.  For  example,  reference  Figure  4-9b.,  if  the  outside  temperature  is  30oC  and  the  pressure  altitude  is  2,010  feet,  follow  the  30oC  value  vertically  until  it  intersects  the  slanted  pressure  altitude  value  of  2,010  feet.  Follow  the  horizontal density altitude value to the left of the graph for the density altitude in thousands  of feet. In this case, the density altitude is approximately 4,300 feet. For a more precise DA  use the complete formula illustrated in Figures 4.9 & Figure 4.10 Temperature variation is  incorporated into the formula for obtaining density altitude from a known pressure altitude.  Each  1oC  variation  from  standard  temperature  changes  the  density  altitude  approximately  120 feet. If the actual temperature is below standard, the density altitude is lowered.   Figure 4.9.  Example.     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     41    Figure 4.10.  Density Altitude Chart.   4.9.3.  There are three different altimeter settings. Listed below are comparisons of the three  altimeter settings:   SETTING    AT AIRPORT    IN THE AIR    Standard QNE   29.92 Hg   1013.25 mb    QNH      QFE    Variable elevation   reading above or   below actual elevation.   Actual elevation   above MSL reading   when aircraft on ground.   Zero elevation   reading when indicated   aircraft on ground.    Positive separation by   pressure level but at   varying altitudes.   Altitude above MSL   (without  consideration   of temperature).    Height above ground   (without   consideration of  temperature.)    4.9.4.  The  QNE  is  always  29.92  inches  Hg  and  results  in  the  altimeter  indicating  height  above the standard datum plane or pressure altitude. This altimeter setting is used above the                                                                        \f  42    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   transition  altitude  (18,000  feet  MSL  in  the  United  States).  The  QNH  altimeter  setting  is  a  pressure reading which, when set in the aircraft altimeter Kollsman window, will cause the  instrument to read its true height above MSL. Although QNH is the standard altimeter setting  throughout most of the world, some locations may give it in millibars. If pressure data cannot  be obtained in inches, use the conversion table in the Flight Information Handbook, Section  D,  to  convert  them.  A  QFE  altimeter  setting  (used  by  a  few  nations)  is  the  actual  surface  pressure  and  is  not  corrected  to  sea  level.  If  QFE  is  set,  the  altimeter  indicates  actual  elevation  above  the  field,  but  does  not  ensure  terrain  clearance.  Aircrews  must  exercise  extreme caution if conducting operations at a location using QFE. An altimeter correctly set  is  good  for  aircraft  traffic  separation  because  any  atmospheric  pressure  or  temperature  deviation is common to all aircraft in the area. It is also useful for landing, since a ground- level  pressure  variation  would  diminish  to  zero.  But  the  pressure  altimeter  will  not  automatically show exact actual height when in flight. It is still the aircrew\u2019s responsibility to  ensure terrain avoidance.   4.9.5.  There are three factors that determine the pressure altimeter:   4.9.5.1.  The atmospheric pressure level which the instrument is measuring.   4.9.5.2.  The mechanical displacement of the indicator needles: the altimeter setting.   4.9.5.3.  Instrument error. (Determined for each individual altimeter)   4.9.6.  Aside from the possible instrument error, it is easy to anticipate the effects of the other  two  variables  by  understanding  the  meteorological  factors:  first,  the  variation  of  sea  level  pressure  from  that  of  the  standard  atmosphere;  and  second,  the  deviation  of  the  vertical  temperature  distribution  from  that  of  the  standard  atmosphere.  At  and  above  the  transition  altitude (18,000 feet MSL in the US), aircraft altimeters must be set to the standard altimeter  setting 29.92 inches Hg. The pilot flying above the transition level must adjust the altimeter  to  the  QNH  setting  when  descending  through  the  transition  level  for  operation  below  that  altitude.  This  will  provide  proper  air  traffic  and  terrain  separation.  When  flying  below  the  transition altitude, the altimeter must be adjusted to the surface pressure setting (QNH) of the  nearest ground reporting station. Even when sea level pressure does not change along a route  of  a  flight,  incorrect  altitude  indications  may  result  from  temperature  changes.  If  the  air  is  much colder than the standard atmosphere, the actual aircraft altitude will be lower than the  altimeter indicates; if the air is warmer, the aircraft will be higher than the altimeter indicates  (Figure 4.11). It is important that crew members understand these errors so that when flying  in cold weather and operating in mountainous regions at minimum en route altitudes (MEA),  they do not have difficulty maintaining terrain clearance.   \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     43    Figure 4.11.  Altitude Error Due to Nonstandard Temperatures Aloft (D-Value).     \f  44    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Chapter 5   WIND   5.1.  Introduction.  Wind  is  moving  air,  and  while  normally  referred  to  as  \u2015wind,\u2016  certain  geographic locations have significant types of winds that are referred to by names. For example,  the  Mediterranean  has  the  Mistral,  the  Rocky  Mountain  region  has  the  Chinook,  Southern  California has a wind called the Santa Ana, and northern Africa has the hot, dry, Sirocco wind.  Whatever it is called, the aviator is concerned with wind on every flight. Winds near the surface  and aloft are important in takeoff, en route, and landing conditions. Knowledge of the winds is  essential for navigation, fuel management, and flight safety purposes.   5.2.  Causes of Wind.   5.2.1.  Atmospheric pressure and temperature variations cause the air to move in two ways:  ascending and descending currents (vertical motions) and the horizontal flow of air known as  wind. Both of these air motions affect the weather. Wind transports water vapor and therefore  plays an important role in the formation of clouds, fog, and precipitation. This chapter will  discuss  mainly  the  horizontal  flow  of  air.  The  vertical  motion  of  air  and  its  impact  upon  weather  is  treated  in  later  chapters.  General  circulation  describes  the  observed  patterns  of  winds  and  pressure  which  persist  throughout  the  year.  General  circulation  patterns  redistribute  the  unequal  heating  of  the  Earth\u2019s  surface  allowing  large  scale  migrations  of  warmer  and  cooler  air.  The  circulations  form  semi-permanent  pressure  systems,  steer  any  migratory  pressure  systems  and  also  determine  where  tropical  storms  may  track.  Also  the  general  circulation  uniquely  balances  many  controlling  factors  such  as  angular  momentum  and  the  Coriolis  force.  The  key  driver  of  atmospheric  circulation  is  uneven  heating  of  the  Earth\u2019s  surface  by  the  sun.  The  most  direct  rays  strike  the  Earth  near  the  equator,  heating  equatorial regions much more than polar regions. Yet the equatorial regions don\u2019t get hotter  and  hotter,  nor  do  the  polar  regions  colder  and  colder  because  the  general  circulation  transports heat between latitudes.   5.2.2.  Because the Earth rotates, and its surface is not even or uniform in heat capacity, three  sets of primary circulation cells develop in both hemispheres (Figure 5.1). The cells closest  to the equator are called the Hadley cells, the mid-latitude cells are called the Ferrel cells, and  the  farthest  cells  are  called  the  Polar  cells.    This  simple  circulation  model  is  constantly  modified by:   5.2.2.1.  The irregular distribution of oceans and continents.   5.2.2.2.  Irregular terrain.   5.2.2.3.  Daily variation in temperature.   5.2.2.4.  Seasonal changes.   \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     45    Figure 5.1.  Three-Cell Model of the Earth\u2019s Circulation.   5.2.3.  When a migrating parcel of air moves either northward or southward, a phenomenon  known  as  the  Coriolis  force  impacts  its  horizontal  motion.  If  the  parcel  of  air  moves  northward to  a higher latitude, as with  the northerly  surface wind typically  associated  with  the Ferrel cell, it will move ahead (to the right) of the point directly north of its initial starting  point due to its greater speed (Figure 5.1). A parcel of air moving from north to south, from  an area with a smaller circumference to an area with a larger one, encounters a lag because it  enters a plane with a greater rim speed than the plane it left. Therefore, because of the lag,  the air parcel would also deflect to the right. From this, we observe that if the only force at  work  is  the  rotation  of  the  Earth,  parcels  of  air  moving  north  or  south  over  considerable  distances deflect to the right in the Northern Hemisphere (Figure 5.1). Therefore, if a parcel  of air migrates from north to south, the parcel will deflect to the west.  The Coriolis force is  strongest at the poles and decreases to zero at the equator, and increases in strength as wind  speed increases.   5.3.  Jet Streams.   5.3.1.  Using the three-cell model discussed earlier, we see that the various circulations due  to unequal heating combine to create the jet streams  that are centered at 30\u00b0N/S and 60\u00b0N/S  on average (Figure  5.2) but  constantly meander  north and south. Winds  generally increase  with height through the troposphere due to the presence of a north-south temperature gradient  in  the mid-latitudes and the conservation of angular momentum, reaching  a maximum near  the  tropopause.    This  wind  maximum  is  called  the  jet  stream.    A  jet  stream,  or  \u2015jet\u2016,  is  a  meandering  region  of  concentrated,  higher  wind  speeds  that  circles  the  Earth.  In  the  wintertime,  there  are  often  two  or  three  predominant  jet  streams:  the  polar-front  jet  (PFJ)  stream, the subtropical and the arctic jet streams. The main and best known jet stream is the  polar-front  jet stream  which frequently enhances major weather system  development  in  the  mid-latitudes.  Within  the  jet  stream  are  concentrated  pockets  of  the  strongest  winds,  often     \f  46    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   called  jet  stream  maxima  or  simply  a  \u2015jet  max\u2016.  The  strongest  vertical  motions  associated  with  jet  streams  occur  under  jet  maxima,  and  these  motions  are  a  major  factor  in  the  development of low pressure systems.   5.3.2.  The  PFJ  is  generally  found  parallel  to  and  on  the  \u2015poleward\u2016  (cold)  side  of  surface  frontal  systems,  generally  in  the  neighborhood  of  30,000  feet;  but,  they  can  be  above  or  below  this  level  depending  on  the  latitude  and  the  season.  In  the  Northern  Hemisphere,  as  you look downwind into the jet stream, you will notice that the air in a jet core slowly rotates  in a counterclockwise direction. If the air is moist, the ascending air on the warm air side will  cause cirrus clouds to form. Strong vertical wind shear may be evident from the windswept  appearance of the trailing ice crystals of hook-shaped cirrus. Very dense cirrostratus clouds  form with an abrupt \u2015poleward\u2016 edge near the jet core. The PFJ has a life cycle of formation,  intensification, movement, and dissipation related to the polar front. The strength of the jet  stream is greater in winter than in summer. The mean position of the polar jet stream shifts  south in winter and north in summer moving with the seasonal migration of the polar front.  As the jet stream moves southward, its core rises to higher altitudes, and on the average, its  speed  increases.  The  core  of  strongest  winds  is  generally  found  between  25,000  feet  and  40,000 feet, depending on latitude and season.   Figure 5.2.  Formation of Jet Streams.   5.4.  Circulation Patterns.   5.4.1.  In  the  Northern  Hemisphere,  air  flows  clockwise  around  high  pressure  areas  and  counterclockwise  around  low  pressure  areas.  This  circulation  pattern  is  referred  to  as  cyclonic  for  a  low  and  anti-cyclonic  for  a  high.  In  briefings  and  forecasts,  you  will  often  encounter  the  term  \u2015pressure  gradient\u2016  or  just  \u2015gradient.\u2016  The  pressure  gradient  is  the  rate  change of pressure or height of a pressure surface (such as 850mb) with horizontal distance  between high and low pressure areas. The  greater the difference in  pressure between highs  and lows, the greater the pressure gradient is between those points. On surface and upper air  charts, closer spacing of the isobars and contours indicate greater differences in pressure over  a  given  distance.  The  closer  the  spacing,  the  faster  air  flows  to  equalize  the  pressure  difference, therefore indicating higher wind speeds. The reason for this begins when a parcel  of air from the higher pressure area starts moving toward the low pressure area. As it does,  the  Coriolis  force  begins  to  swing  the  parcel  of  air  to  the  right.  The  force  initiating  the     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     47    horizontal movement (pressure gradient force) still exerts its pull, now to the left. When the  pressure  gradient  force  balances  the  Coriolis  force,  the  air  blows  parallel  to  the  isobars  or  contours. As this parcel of air enters these \u2015lanes\u2016 between isobars or contours, it is virtually  squeezed through the narrower channels formed by the stronger pressure gradient, and shown  on  the  surface  chart  by  a  closer  spacing  of  the  isobars.  Thus  the  moving  parcel  of  air,  channeled into a narrower corridor, picks up speed. The wind will lose speed if the air enters  an area where the isobars indicate a lower pressure gradient (by being spaced farther apart).  Without the Coriolis force, a parcel of air would move directly across the isobars from high  to the lower pressure until the pressure equalized. This attempt to equalize pressure initiates  the movement of the parcel of air from the higher to lower pressure area.   5.4.2.  If  you  measure  the  perpendicular  distance  between  the  two  adjoining  isobars  in  Figure  5.3,  the  difference  between  A  and  B,  and  C  and  D  is  4  mb.  However,  the  4  mb  difference between A and B occurs over a shorter distance, making the pressure gradient and  resultant  winds stronger  than those between C  and D. Pressure  gradients  may  be described  as: steep, strong, flat, or weak. From a practical standpoint, it is sufficient to remember that  the gradient (and wind) is strongest where the isobars or contours are closest.   Figure 5.3.  Pressure Gradient Versus Wind Speed.   5.4.3.  Aircrew Note.   5.4.3.1.  If you need to get away from high velocity pressure gradient winds, the quickest  route is to fly perpendicular to the winds with the wind flowing right to left; this will lead  you toward the High pressure area and lower winds. If you fly with the wind flowing left  to right, you will be going toward the Low, and toward higher winds.   5.4.4.  Surface friction slows air movement. Since the Coriolis force varies with wind speed,  a reduction in the wind speed by friction means a reduction in the Coriolis force. This results  in  a  disruption  of the  balance  between  the  Coriolis  and  pressure  gradient  forces.  When  the  new balance, including friction, is reached, the air blows at an angle across the isobars from     \f  48    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   high  to  low  pressure.  This  angle  varies  from  10o  over  the  oceans  to  as  much  as  45o  over"

            "text":"rugged terrain. Friction effects on the air are greatest near the ground, but the effects are also  carried aloft by ascending currents. Surface friction slows winds up to about 2,000 or 3,000  feet AGL (Figure 5.4). Above this level, friction effects decrease rapidly and are negligible  for all practical purposes. Therefore, air about 3,000 feet or more AGL tends to flow parallel  to the contours. As a result of changing pressure patterns with height, the flow of air around  high  and  low  pressure  areas  above  the  surface  friction  layer  may  be  entirely  different  than  indicated  on  the  surface  chart.  It  is  quite  possible  for  the  surface  wind  to  be  light  and  variable, while the 30,000 foot wind has a speed of over 100 knots. In forecasting winds at  flight  level,  the  forecaster uses the  constant  pressure chart nearest  that level,  instead of the  surface chart.   Figure 5.4.  Surface Winds are Deflected Across Isobars Toward Lower Pressure.   5.5.  Cyclones and Anticyclone (Highs and Lows).   5.5.1.  People living in the temperate zone and farther north know that their weather changes  with the alternate passage of cyclones (low pressure systems) and anticyclones (high pressure  systems).  These  migrating  systems  usually  move  from  west  to  east  with  the  prevailing  westerly  winds.  They  are  accompanied  by  wind  shifts,  rapid  changes  in  temperature,  and  broad areas of precipitation. Migrating cyclones and anticyclones are the primary means for  the  heat  exchange  between  high  and  low  latitudes.  Lows  (cyclones)  are  usually  a  few  hundred miles in diameter. Highs (anticyclones) are generally larger and more elongated, the  longer axis sometimes extending over 2,000 miles.   5.5.2.  Hurricanes  (intense  low  pressure  areas)  originate  over  the  Atlantic  Ocean,  the  Caribbean  Sea,  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  and  the  eastern  Pacific  along  the  coasts  of  Central  America and Mexico. In the tropical areas of the northwestern Pacific Ocean, they are called  \u2015typhoons.\u2016  In  the  Indian  Ocean  near  the  east  coast  of  Africa,  and  in  the  Southern  Hemisphere, they are called \u2015tropical cyclones.\u2016 The extremely low pressure, intense winds,  torrential rains, and other characteristics of hurricanes, typhoons, and tropical cyclones will  be  discussed  in  several  chapters  of  this  handbook.  Their  treatment  in  detail  is  reserved  for  Chapter 14, Tropical Weather, since these phenomena originate in the tropics.   5.6.  Local Effects Winds.     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     49    5.6.1.  Zooming in from the global circulation and the transient pressure systems, we get to  the local effects wind systems created by an area\u2019s geography. These local wind systems can  cause  significant  changes  in  the  area\u2019s  weather.  The  term  \u2015local,\u2016  in  the  case  of  wind  systems,  applies  to  areas  whose  sizes  range  from  tens  of  miles  (e.g.,  mountain  passes),  to  hundreds of miles (e.g., Gulf Coast sea breeze). In any case, local  geographical differences  determine the size and degree of local wind development. Land surfaces warm and cool more  rapidly  than  water  surfaces  through  incoming  solar  radiation  (insolation)  and  outgoing  (terrestrial) radiation. Therefore, the land is normally warmer than the sea during the day and  colder at night. This difference in temperature is more noticeable during the summer months  and  when  there  is  little  horizontal  transport  of  air  in  the  low  levels.  In  coastal  areas,  this  difference of temperature between the land and water produces a corresponding difference in  pressure (a pressure gradient). During the day the pressure over the warm land is lower than  over  the  colder  water.  The  low-level  cool  air  over  the  water  moves  toward  the  lower  pressure, forcing the warm air over land upward. The resulting cool onshore wind is a \u2015sea  breeze.\u2016  At  night  the  circulation  reverses  so  that  the  air  movement  is  from  land  to  sea,  producing a warm offshore wind called \u2015land breeze.\u2016  Sea breezes are usually stronger than  land breezes, but they seldom penetrate far inland. Both land and sea breezes (Figure 5.5) are  shallow in depth. Ten to twenty knot sea breezes are common.   Figure 5.5.  Sea and Land Breezes.   5.7.  Valley Wind and Mountain Breeze.       \f  50    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   5.7.1.  In  the  daytime,  air  next  to  a  mountain  slope  heats  by  contact  with  the  ground  as  it  receives  radiation  from  the  sun.  This  air  becomes  warmer  than  the  surrounding  air  farther  away from the slope. Colder, denser air in the surrounding areas settles downward and forces  the warmer air near the ground up the mountain producing the valley wind, so called because  the air flows up out of the valley (Figure 5.6). These winds are of particular importance for  light  aircraft,  helicopter,  and  low-level  operations.  At  night  the  air  in  contact  with  the  mountain  slope  cools  by  outgoing  terrestrial  radiation  and  becomes  denser  than  the  surrounding  air.  It  sinks  along  the  slope  producing  the  mountain  breeze.  In  mountainous  areas  where  the  performance  of  some  fixed  wing  aircraft  or  helicopters  is  marginal,  the  location of valley and mountain winds can be critical.   Figure 5.6.  Valley Wind and Mountain Breeze.   5.8.  Katabatic Winds.   5.8.1.  A  katabatic  wind  is  any  wind  blowing  down  an  incline.  The  mountain  breeze,  therefore, is a type of katabatic wind. If the down-slope wind is warm relative to the air in the       \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     51    valley or plain below, it is called a foehn. If the down-slope wind is cold, it is called either a  fall wind or a gravity wind. Many katabatic winds recurring in local areas have been given  colorful  names due to  their dramatic effect.  For example, the warm wind located along the  eastern slopes of the Rockies is  called a Chinook (Figure  5.7). As air rises it cools  and its  moisture  condenses  out  during  ascent  on  the  western  slopes.    The  latent  heat  released  by  condensing water vapor warms the air parcel. As it flows downhill, the parcel heats further  due to compression. A Chinook can raise the temperature at the base of a mountain 30oF in a  few minutes. Another example is the Santa Ana wind, a foehn wind which descends from the  Sierra Nevada Mountains into the Santa Ana Valley of California. This hot, dry wind is noted  for its high speeds and extremely low humidities. Fall winds are found in very cold plateau  regions (Figure 5.8). In southeastern Alaska there is a fall wind known as the Taku, while in  the Alps there is one known as the Bora. Because the cold air is heavy, it flows downhill due  to gravity, resulting in a shallow wind sometimes attaining high speeds. These winds usually  affect  a  rather  large  area  and  may  occur  during  the  day  or  night.  Fall  winds  are  usually  stronger at night, though, because radiational cooling of the ground further cools the air.   Figure 5.7.  Chinook Wind.     \f  52    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 5.8.  Fall or Bora Wind.   5.9.  Upslope Winds.   5.9.1.  Upslope  winds  flow  up  a  slope  or  a  valley  during  the  day.  Air  adjacent  to  a  slope  facing the sun becomes warmer and less dense than the air at the same level some distance  from  the  slope.  The  warm  air  becomes  buoyant  and  floats  up  the  slope.  Surface  heating,  a  frequent ingredient of thunderstorm development, develops instability which causes the flow  to be turbulent. The depth of the upslope wind increases with height, and the air can become  very turbulent at the top of the hill or ridge. For the same reason, air tends to flow up a valley  during the day rather than along isobars. In these situations there will be an upslope wind on  the sunny side of the valley and a down-slope wind on the shaded side.   5.10.  Down-slope Winds.   5.10.1.  A down-slope wind may consist of either a warm or cold flow of air down a slope  and  may  develop  into  an  extremely  strong  wind  with  dangerous  shears.  Air  cooled  by  radiational  cooling  at  night  becomes  dense  and  is  pulled  by  gravity  down  the  natural  pathways of hills and mountains to collect in the valleys; then it flows down the valleys out  onto the plains or oceans. The flow tends to be shallow and streamlined. The glacier wind is  a  form  of  down-slope  wind  that  can  develop  to  hazardous  proportions  if  the  cooling  is  extreme.  This  can  occur  over  glaciers  where  shallow  winds  of  80  knots  or  more  can  form.  The winds blow downhill both day and night in this case because the cooling is caused by the  underlying ice. At times the flow is pulsating with the cold air building up to a critical point  and then being released in a rush down the slope.   5.10.2.  Aircrew Note.   5.10.2.1.  Since the wind at any level blows according to the pressure system at that level,  there  is  a  definite  connection  between  wind  and  altimeter  error.  If  you  are  flying  at  10,000  feet  and  are  experiencing  a  direct  headwind  or  tailwind,  you  must  be  flying  parallel  to  the  isobars.  There  is  no  pressure  change  to  affect  the  accuracy  of  your  altimeter.  If  during  flight  you  experience  a  marked  drift  to  the  left,  you  will  be  approaching an area of higher pressure. If the drift is to the right, you are approaching  an  area  of  lower  pressure.  During  a  flight  at  higher  levels,  the  observed  wind  will     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     53    indicate the pressure pattern at flight level, which may not be the same as the pressure  pattern at the surface. If you are flying at a constant pressure level, a marked left-hand  drift  indicates  the  aircraft  is  gradually  gaining  altitude  and  a  marked  right-hand  drift  indicates  the  aircraft  is  gradually  losing  altitude,  although  in  both  cases  the  altimeter  reading  would  remain  unchanged.  Therefore,  winds  determined  during  flight  can  be  of  great value in assessing altimeter errors due to pressure.   \f  54    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Chapter 6   CLOUDS   6.1.  Introduction.  Clouds  display  a  wealth  of  information  about  present  and  future  weather.  They  provide  visible  evidence  of  atmospheric  motions,  water  content,  and  stability.  A  good  working knowledge of cloud types enables fliers to reasonably understand what flying weather to  expect. Clouds are classified by their height and appearance. Puffy cumulus clouds are the \u2015fair  weather clouds\u2016 while the nimbostratus clouds \u2015look like rain.\u2016 Altocumulus standing lenticular  clouds  usually  indicate  mountain  wave  turbulence,  while  large,  cumulonimbus  clouds  mean  trouble!  Since  there  are  such  a  variety  of  clouds,  meteorologists  have  simplified  cloud  identification  by  using  ten  cloud  genera  defined  by  the  World  Meteorological  Organization  (WMO).  This  chapter  will  introduce  cloud  formation  processes  and  cloud  composition.  It  will  further explain the cloud types, typical heights, and specific characteristics of each type. Cloud  pictures  will  help  identify  the  different  types.  The  chapter  will  conclude  by  looking  at  special  cloud formations and topics.   6.2.  Cloud Composition.   6.2.1.  Chapter 2 indicated that clouds are composed of minute liquid water droplets and/or  ice  crystals,  depending  on  the  cloud\u2019s  temperature.  When  the  outside  air  temperature  is  between  0oC  and  -20oC,  clouds  are  largely  composed  of  supercooled  water  droplets,  and  usually  contain  some  ice  particles.  Ice  crystals  predominate  at  temperatures  lower  than  - 20oC. However, supercooled water droplets can exist at temperatures as low as -40oC. If the  cloud droplets become large enough, they are no longer buoyant and they begin to slowly fall  as supercooled or naturally occurring water droplets. The droplets stick together or coalesce  and  fall  faster  eventually  becoming  precipitation.  The  cloud  temperature  and  atmospheric  stability determines the precipitation type. A stable atmosphere favors precipitation droplets  of  a  more  uniform  size.  Condensation  nuclei,  such  as  windblown  dusts,  sea-salt,  and  combustion  by-products,  compose  the  centers  of  cloud  particles.  The  presence  of  condensation nuclei is necessary for the formation of water droplets. Most nuclei are found  within  the  first  few  kilometers  of  the  ground.  Within  higher  elevations,  complex  cloud  physics  processes  allow  condensation  nuclei  to  grow  and  gradually  overcome  gravity.  The  type of condensation nuclei also  is  a determining factor of how fast  a precipitation  particle  will grow.   6.3.  Cloud Families.   6.3.1.  The  forms  and  varieties  of  clouds  have  always  challenged  those  whose  livelihoods  depended  upon  the  weather.  Aircrews  can  also  learn  the  language  of  clouds  and  use  this  information. Although the weather field has become highly technological and computerized,  basic  cloud  knowledge  will  still  reap  dividends  for  aircrews.  For  our  purpose,  aircrews  should be concerned with only the basic cloud types, which are divided into four \u2015families.\u2016  The basic cloud types are low clouds, middle clouds, high clouds, and clouds with extensive  vertical development (Figure 6l.). The average height of middle and high clouds varies with  latitude,  time  of  year,  and  with  the  tropopause  height.  Low  cloud  altitudes  vary  little  with  latitude.  Low,  middle,  and  high  cloud  families  are  further  classified  according  to  the  way  they are formed. There are two basic types of clouds, cumulus and stratus, and the degree of   \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     55    the  air\u2019s  stability  largely  determines  cloud  type.  Clouds  formed  by  vertical  currents  of  unstable air are called cumulus, meaning \u2015accumulation\u2016 or \u2015heap.\u2016 They are characterized  by  their  lumpy,  billowy  appearance.  Due  to  the  associated  vertical  air  currents,  there  is  always some degree of turbulence within and beneath cumuliform clouds. Clouds formed by  the  cooling  of  a  stable  layer  are  called  stratus,  meaning  \u2015spread  out\u2016  and  appear  layered.  They  are  characterized  by  their  uniform,  sheet-like  appearance.  Stratiform  clouds,  having  little or no vertical motion, experience little or no turbulence.   Figure 6.1.  Basic Cloud Types.   6.3.2.  In  addition  to  cloud  family  descriptions,  different  prefixes  and  suffixes  are  added  to  create descriptions of combination-type clouds. For example, the prefix nimbo or the suffix  nimbus, meaning \u2015rain cloud,\u2016 is added to the name of precipitation producing clouds. Thus  a  rain-producing  stratiform  cloud  is  called  nimbostratus,  while  a  developing  cumulus  growing  into  a  thunderstorm  is  referred  to  as  cumulonimbus.  Heights  of  the  various  cloud  types are illustrated in Figure 6.2     \f  56    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 6.2.  Cloud Heights.   6.4.  Low Clouds.   6.4.1.  Low  clouds  consist  of  stratus,  stratocumulus,  and  cumulus.  Cloud  bases  range  from  the  surface  to  about  6,500  feet  AGL.  Clouds  forming  below  50  feet  and  extending  to  the  surface  are  classified  as  fog.  During  the  summer,  low  clouds  are  almost  entirely  water  droplets.  During  colder  weather,  these  clouds  may  consist  of  ice  crystals  or  supercooled  water  droplets  and  may  therefore  cause  icing  conditions  hazardous  to  aircraft.  A  brief  description of each low cloud follows.   6.4.1.1.  Stratus (ST) is a low, uniform, sheet-like cloud (Figure 6.3). Stratus clouds tend  to be between a couple hundred to thousands of feet thick and produce only drizzle, ice  prisms, or ice crystals. When associated with fog or heavier precipitation, stratus clouds  often become mixed with nimbostratus clouds, which are discussed later. Stratus clouds  often present problems by causing low ceilings and restricted visibilities. A slowly lifting  fog layer often becomes stratus clouds before dissipation. Finally, fog formed over water  bodies and driven inland by onshore winds becomes stratus. While stratus clouds indicate  stable flying conditions, extended flying through stratus clouds with temperatures below  freezing can cause hazardous icing conditions.   Figure 6.3.  Stratus Clouds (ST).       \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     57    6.4.1.2.  Stratocumulus (SC) clouds appear as large, globular masses or rolls which look  like dirty gray cotton balls (Figure 6.4). They often result from a layer of stable air lifted  and  mixed  by  wind  blowing  over  rough  terrain.  Stratocumulus  also  forms  from  the  breaking up of a stratus layer and from the spreading out of cumulus clouds. Ceilings and  visibilities are generally higher with stratocumulus clouds than in stratus.   Figure 6.4.  Stratocumulus Clouds (SC).   6.4.1.3.  Cumulus (CU) clouds form as warmed \u2015blobs\u2016 of air rise and visibly condense.  They  can  also  form  as  a  cold  air  mass  warms  as  it  passes  over  a  warmer  surface.  Relatively  flat  bases,  dome-shaped  tops,  and  a  cauliflower  appearance  characterize  cumulus  (Figure  6.5).  Fair  weather  cumulus  indicates  a  shallow  layer  of  instability.  Expect some light turbulence and no significant icing or precipitation. If cumulus clouds  continue  to  vertically  develop,  they  become  towering  cumulus  and  can  eventually  become cumulonimbus clouds.   Figure 6.5.  Cumulus Clouds (CU).   6.5.  Middle Clouds.   6.5.1.  In  the  middle  cloud  family  are  altostratus,  altocumulus,  and  nimbostratus  clouds.  In  the  middle  latitudes,  middle  cloud  bases  range  from  about  6,500  feet  to  about  20,000  feet       \f  58    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   AGL.  These  clouds  may  be  composed  of  ice  crystals,  water  droplets,  and/or  supercooled  water  droplets.  The  middle  cloud  family  has  the  most  variation  of  the  four  families  and  contains a few of the most dangerous clouds, notably the altocumulus standing lenticular and  rotor  clouds  which  indicate  the  likelihood  of  moderate  to  severe  turbulence.  Therefore,  accurate recognition can be crucial to flight safety.   6.5.1.1.  Altostratus  (AS) are relatively uniform gray to  blue sheets  covering the entire  sky (Figure 6.6). Altostratus will signal the arrival of a warm front or approaching storm  by  appearing  as  a  thinly  veiled,  whitish-gray  sheet.  The  sunlight  dimly  shines  through  this higher altostratus cloud deck as though shining through frosted glass. The altostratus  usually  becomes  thicker  or  lowers  until  the  sun  gradually  disappears  and  assumes  a  grayer,  uniform  appearance.  Light  precipitation  usually  will  form  in  lower  altostratus  clouds. Aircraft experience little or no turbulence but may experience moderate icing in  this type of cloud.   Figure 6.6.  Altostratus Clouds (AS).   6.5.1.2.  Altocumulus  (AC)  white  or  gray  patches  of  solid  cloud  (Figure  6.7).  Altocumulus  also  can  be  composed  of  both  water  and  ice  crystals  of  varying  compositions.  These  clouds  are  associated  with  many  types  of  approaching  frontal  systems  and  often  signal  a  change  in  the  weather  in  the  next  few  hours.  Altocumulus  develops from dissolving altostratus or lifted cumulus. Altocumulus clouds can appear as  layered cells and also be encountered at differing altitudes.   6.5.1.2.1.  Note:  Altocumulus  clouds  aligned  in  rows  parallel  with  mountainous  terrain usually signal turbulence. Aligned altocumulus cloud patterns can be spotted  on visible satellite imagery and should be treated with utmost respect. A particularly  dangerous variety of altocumulus is the altocumulus standing lenticular (ACSL). It is  discussed in the Special Cloud Types section of this chapter.     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     59    Figure 6.7.  Altocumulus Clouds (AC).   6.5.1.3.  Nimbostratus  (NS)  is  a  gray  or  dark,  extensive  cloud  layer  accompanied  by  continuous precipitation (Figure 6.8). This cloud is classified as a middle-cloud, although  it generally extends downward into the low cloud ranges. Nimbostratus appears as dense,  threatening clouds, and often produces nearly continuous periods of precipitation. When  precipitation  becomes  heavy,  the  bases  of  nimbostratus  clouds  become  obscured  and  affect cloud measuring equipment making the ceiling difficult to determine. Nimbostratus  clouds can vertically extend in a continuous cloud layer from a couple hundred feet AGL  up to 20,000 feet or more. Flight visibility is considerably reduced in heavy precipitation.  Ragged  cloud  shreds  underneath  nimbostratus  clouds  are  called  stratus  fractus.  This  particular variety of stratus often accompanies strong low level wind conditions and often  extends below the observed ceiling.   Figure 6.8.  Nimbostratus Clouds (NS).   6.6.  High Clouds.   6.6.1.  Cirrus,  cirrostratus,  and  cirrocumulus--the  cirriform  clouds--are  the  most  common  upper  level  clouds.  These  cloud  bases  range  from  about  16,000  to  45,000  feet  in  mid- latitudes. The upper limit of these clouds may be as high as 60,000 feet in the tropics. Since  cirriform clouds are composed of ice crystals, they do not present a significant icing hazard.  Thick cirriform clouds can affect air refueling operations by restricting in-flight visibilities.       \f  60    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   6.6.1.1.  Cirrus (CI) clouds are thin, feathery clouds in patches or narrow bands (Figure  6.9). Clouds arranged in bands or connected with cirrostratus or altostratus may be a sign  of approaching bad weather. Wispy cirrus appearing to have trailing tails or looking like  \u2015mares  tails\u2016  indicates  upper  level  wind  direction  and  relative  speed.  Note:  Cirriform  clouds  can  also  indicate  the  presence  of  a  jet  stream  (see  Chapters  5  and  9).The  tail  is  formed  by  precipitating  ice  crystals  falling  into  slower  moving,  lower  level  winds  thus  forming the \u2015tail\u2016 appearance.   6.6.1.1.1.  Cirrus  clouds  often  extend  from  the  upper  part  of  thunderstorms  or  cumulonimbus clouds in what is known as the cirrus anvil. They can blow away from  the main cloud, or the main portion of the cloud may evaporate, leaving only the ice  crystal top portion. Cirrus clouds herald incoming bad weather or indicate that stormy  weather is still several hundred miles away.   Figure 6.9.  Cirrus Clouds (CI).   6.6.1.2.  Cirrostratus  clouds  are  thin,  whitish  cloud  layers  appearing  as  a  sheet  or  veil  (Figure 6.10). The ice crystals composing cirrostratus may produce halos. Sunshine will  appear slightly dimmed through cirrostratus clouds. Gradually thickening cirrostratus will  eventually transition into high level altostratus clouds. Classic cirrostratus usually signals  the  approach  of  a  warm  front  within  12  to  24  hours.  Since  cirrostratus  occur  only  in  stable layers, expect little to no turbulence. Icing, if any, is light and normally poses no  significant hazards.     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     61    Figure 6.10.  Cirrostratus Clouds (CS).   6.6.1.3.  Cirrocumulus  (CC)  clouds  are  thin,  closely-spaced,  individual  elements,  appearing as small cotton balls (Figure 6.11). This cloud may result from the lifting of a  shallow unstable layer, but more often develops from a layer of cirrostratus and consists  primarily  of  ice  crystals.  Heat  loss  by  radiation  occurs  from  the  top  of  the  cirrus  layer,  and the cooler air sinks into the cloud, setting up shallow convective currents within the  layer. Large layers of cirrocumulus can form the so-called \u2015mackerel sky.\u2016 Cirrocumulus  signals upper level instability and can precede thunderstorms by up to 12 hours. Expect  some turbulence in cirrocumulus.   Figure 6.11.  Cirrocumulus Clouds (CC).   6.7.  Clouds With Extensive Vertical Development.   6.7.1.  Clouds  in  the  extensive  vertical  development  family  are  towering  cumulus  and  cumulonimbus.  Their  bases  range  from  the  low  to  middle  categories  and  their  tops  up  through  the  high  category.  These  cloud  types  are  treated  separately  because  of  their  significance to flying operations.       \f  62    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   6.7.1.1.  Towering Cumulus (TCU) is an important variety of the cumulus cloud. It is a  transition type cloud between the fair weather cumulus and the eventual cumulonimbus  (CB)  cloud.  Not  all  towering  cumulus  clouds  become  cumulonimbus  but  towering  cumulus  does  indicate  the  potential  for  further  vertical  development  (Figure  6.12).  Towering cumulus clouds signal changes in atmospheric stability from stable to unstable.  Carefully  watch  for  rapidly  growing  towering  cumulus  clouds  because  it  indicates  an  unstable atmosphere with thunderstorms probable within minutes. The towering cumulus  is  usually  accompanied  by  turbulence  and  icing.  TCUs  are  significant  enough  to  be  reported  by  weather  technicians  in  their  official  observations  when  located  at  a  manual  observing station.   Figure 6.12.  Towering Cumulus Clouds (TCU).   6.7.1.2.  Cumulonimbus (CB). Cumulonimbus clouds are large, dense, towering clouds  with cauliflower-like tops. The mature cumulonimbus\u2019 top portion is often flattened into  the  classic  anvil  shape  or  consists  of  a  cirrus  formation  (Figure  6.13).  Water  droplets  form the major portion of cumulonimbus, but ice crystals appear in the upper portions.   6.7.1.2.1.  Note:  Cumulonimbus  terms.  Cumulonimbus results in strong winds, lightning, and potentially heavy rains. A well  developed cumulonimbus can spawn hail and tornadoes. Dangerous wind shears are  often encountered with strong updrafts and downdrafts associated with thunderstorm  activity. An expanded review of this well respected cloud is treated in Chapter 13.   thunderstorm   synonymous"

Altocumulus  Standing  Lenticular  (ACSL)  clouds  form  on  the  crests  of  waves  created  by  barriers  in  the  wind  flow  (Figure  6.14).  Condensation  in  the  wave\u2019s  ascending  portion  forms  the  cloud.  In  the  wave\u2019s  descending  portion,  the  cloud  evaporates.  Thus,  the  cloud  appears  not  to  move  although  very  strong  winds  can  blow  through  it.  Avoid  these  clouds,  since  their  presence  is  a  good  indicator  of  severe  turbulence.  (See  Chapter  9,  Mountain Wave Turbulence.)   Figure 6.14.  Altocumulus Standing Lenticular (ACSL).   6.8.2.  Rotor clouds form on the lee side of mountains. Rotor clouds look like a line of small  cumulus clouds parallel to the mountain (Figure 6.15). The rotor cloud gives visible clues to       \f  64    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   probable  turbulence  associated  with  mountain  wave  activity.  Aircrews  may  encounter  extreme  turbulence  in  the  vicinity  of  rotor  clouds.  Chapter  9,  Mountain  Wave  Turbulence,  contains further descriptions.   Figure 6.15.  Rotor Clouds.   6.8.3.  Contrails or condensation trails are clouds formed (Figure 6.16) in an aircraft\u2019s wake  when  the  moisture  content  of  the  air  at  a  particular  temperature  exceeds  a  critical  amount.  This  condition  can  be  attained  by  two  methods:  (1)  adding  water  vapor  from  an  external  source (exhaust contrails), or (2) changing the temperature and pressure of the air so that the  resulting mixture is saturated (aerodynamic contrails). Jet aircraft produce contrails by both  methods. A jet engine consumes large quantities of fuel and emits a large amount of water  vapor forming the engine exhaust contrails. Engine exhaust contrails form when water vapor  in the exhaust gas mixes with and saturates the air in which the aircraft flies. Winter is the  season of maximum exhaust contrail formation, since cold air reaches saturation faster than  warm  air.  A  change  in  altitude  or  power  setting  may  eliminate  exhaust  contrails.  If  the  aircraft is flying through a dry, stable environment, contrails will either be short lived or fail  to form at all. Aerodynamic contrails result from the rapid movement of air over the wings  and  body  of  the  aircraft  momentarily  reducing  air  pressure.  This  reduction  allows  the  surrounding  moisture  to  condense,  forming  a  contrail  until  the  pressure  increases  and  stabilizes.   6.8.4.  Aircrew Note.   6.8.4.1.  In  a  tactical  environment,  contrails  highlight  an  aircraft\u2019s  position.  Of  course,  this  seriously  degrades  the  effectiveness  of  aircraft  missions  during  combat  operations.  During  mission  planning,  ask  the  forecaster  about  the  likelihood  of  contrail  formation  and  the  altitudes  expected  for  contrail  formation.  Reporting  contrails  on  a  pilot  report  (PIREP) alerts other aviators to their existence.     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     65    Figure 6.16.

An understanding of air masses helps aircrews anticipate  certain kinds of flying weather associated with particular air masses. Certain air masses are more  prone to develop persistent cloudiness and shower activity while other air masses generally have  clear skies and few flying hazards. For example, if an air mass is of arctic origin, it will usually  have little moisture content and have strong temperature inversions relatively close to the Earth\u2019s  surface.  Summertime  continental  polar  air  masses  from  Canada  are  quite  refreshing  after  an  extended  bout  of  maritime  tropical  \u2015hazy,  hot,  and  humid\u2016  weather.  Tropical  air  masses  have  much  higher  moisture  content  and  higher  average  temperatures  from  the  surface  to  the  tropopause.  Whether  an  air  mass  forms  in  a  dry  desert  region  or  a  moist  maritime  region  also  determines  flying  weather  conditions.  Collisions  between  two  differing  air  masses  result  in  a  variety of weather along fronts. Let\u2019s examine air masses in closer detail.   7.2.  Air Mass Types.   7.2.1.  A  detailed  worldwide  air  mass  analysis  is  beyond  the  scope  and  space  of  this  handbook.  This  section  presents  a  general  description  of  common  air  masses  affecting  the  continental  United  States.  The  same  kinds  of source  region  conditions  also  characterize  air  masses which affect Europe and Asia.   7.2.1.1.  Continental polar (cP): Air stagnating over northern continental regions forms  continental polar or continental arctic (cA) air masses. They are cold and dry, with little  moisture. Their source region is very stable.   7.2.1.2.  Maritime polar (mP): Form over northern oceanic areas. Generally, they are not  as cold as cP air masses (especially in winter), have higher moisture content, and can be  either stable or unstable.   7.2.1.3.  Maritime  tropical  (mT):  Form  over warm oceanic areas near 30\u00b0N latitude in  the high-pressure cells. Has high moisture content and is stable in its source region. When  moving  over  land  in  the  summer,  maritime  tropical  air  becomes  unstable  due  to  the  warmer temperatures over land.  This results in hot and humid conditions with afternoon  thunderstorm  development  during  periods  of  maximum  heating.    Meanwhile,  when  moving  over  land  in  the  winter,  maritime  tropical  air  will  tend  to  stabilize  due  to  the  cooler temperatures over land.  This results in foggy and/or stratiform conditions.   7.2.1.4.  Continental tropical (cT): Forms over desert or high plateau regions. These air  masses are hot, dry, and unstable. Due to the absence of water vapor, they produce few  showers.  When  precipitation  forms,  it  tends  to  be  high-based  thunderstorms  with  virga  and/or  short,  intense  showers  which  can  cause  flash  flooding  and  strong,  damaging  winds.   7.3.  Air Mass Modification.   7.3.1.  Just  as  an  air  mass  tends  to  take  on  the  temperature  and  moisture  properties  of  its  source region, it also modifies when moving to a new location. The modification processes   \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     67    affect  air  mass  moisture  and  stability  and  ultimately  determine  the  predominant  air  mass  weather. The degree of air mass modification is dependent on the following factors:   7.3.1.1.  The speed at which it travels.   7.3.1.2.  The terrain of the region it moves over.   7.3.1.3.  The temperature difference between the new surface and the air mass.   7.3.1.4.  The depth of the air mass.   7.3.2.  When a cold air mass flows over a warmer surface, heat flows from the ground to the  air. Convective currents carry the heat to higher and higher levels. This results in the air mass  becoming  more  unstable.  The  convective  process  mixes  the  air,  reducing  the  temperature  differences between the land surface and the air mass. The following analogy will illustrate  the convective process. If a large pan of water is heated on a stove, the heated water rises to  the top of the pan. As long as direct heat is applied to the pan, the heated water distributes the  heat by mixing with its environment while rising to the water surface. The warmer water has  become unstable and will rise because the rising water is attempting to equalize the pan water  temperature.  The  locally  warmed  pockets  of  rising  water  are  thermals  and  closely  simulate  the  atmosphere\u2019s  actions.  Locally  warmed  parcels  of  air  will  also  rise,  producing  thermals.  Thermals are simply rising convective air currents which allow heat transfer to take place and  can visually be seen as cumulus clouds. Thermals can also cause light turbulence in the lower  levels.   7.4.  Air Mass Modification by Terrain.   7.4.1.  Terrain changes will also modify an air mass within a relatively short distance. Water  vapor can be added to the lower layers of an air mass due to evaporation from water surfaces;  lakes,  rivers,  swampy  terrain,  falling  liquid  precipitation,  or  sublimation  from  ice  or  snow  surfaces. Elevation differences can deplete air of moisture as the air is forced up the sloping  terrain. The sharpness of terrain differences determines the extent of air mass modification.  Gently forced air, such as moist air circulating northward from the Gulf of Mexico into Texas  and  Oklahoma,  can  produce  extensive  stratus  cloud  shields.  The  stratus  cloud  shields  can  gradually move north until reaching as far as eastern Nebraska and Kansas, Iowa, Illinois and  southern Minnesota. Air forced up mountain slopes often results in clouds on the windward  side.  Precipitation  and  cloud  cover  amounts  widely  vary  from  the  windward  side  of  mountains compared with the leeward side. On the windward side, as air condenses releasing  moisture, the unstable air eventually rises on its own and is forced down-slope on the leeward  side (Figure  7.1). This air, heated by compression, is much warmer and drier resulting in a  cloud  free  area.  The  persistent  cloud  free  area  on  the  leeward  side  of  mountain  ranges  is  called  the  rain  shadow  effect.  The  stability  of  an  air  mass  determines  its  typical  weather  characteristics.   \f  68    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 7.1.  Sinking Air Increases Stability, can Create Inversion.   7.5.  Air Mass Stability.   7.5.1.  When  an  air  mass  flows  over  a  colder  surface,  heat  transfers  from  the  air  to  the  ground. This cooling from below increases the air mass\u2019s stability. If the air cools to its dew  point,  stratus  and/or  fog  form.  There  is  no  limit  to  how  stable  an  air  mass  can  become.  Prolonged  cooling  in  the  lower  layers  can  set  up  conditions  so  stable  that  daytime  heating  cannot overcome the extreme stability and there will not be any convective currents. Many  locations in the United States are favorable for stable air to become entrenched and stagnate.  Local topography helps maintain stability by trapping stable air and not allowing circulation  or drainage. Haze, fog, stratus,  and smog  can form  in  the cooled  air  and  restricted  ceilings  and visibilities can remain for weeks. A few notorious western locations are the Sacramento  and San Joaquin Valleys of California and Oregon\u2019s Medford Valley. Some of the worst air  pollution  cases  have  also  resulted  from  air  stagnation.  The  Los  Angeles  basin,  industrial  cities  in  England,  and  some  Mediterranean  cities  are  favorable  for  thick  smog  formation.  Normal  upward  convective  currents  cannot  penetrate  the  inversion,  so  smoke,  automobile  exhaust and other pollutants spread out laterally butting against the mountains. Extreme cases  of air stagnation can reduce slant visibilities to l/2 mile or less with horizontal visibilities not  much  better.  Another  common  situation  develops  when  advection  stratus  and  fog  forms  in  the cooling, stable air. Advection stratus and fog forms over a water source and moves over  land  areas;  many  parts  of  England,  Newfoundland,  and  the  southeastern  coast  of  China  experience this  fog problem.  In the United States,  it frequently  happens  along  much of the  Pacific Coast, in the southeastern United States, and along the lee shores of the Great Lakes  and other large water bodies.   Table 7.1.  lists typical characteristics of stable and unstable air masses, assuming that  sufficient moisture is available.   Table 7.1.

Introduction.  When  most  people  think  of  weather,  they  think  of  common  weather  forecaster  terms  such  as  cold  fronts,  warm  fronts,  and  high  or  low  pressure  systems  with  the  associated weather. Weather programs focus on frontal weather for good reason. Active weather  is  concentrated  along fronts.  The term  \u2015front\u2016 was  coined in  the early 1920\u2019s by Scandinavian  meteorologists who found it advantageous to discuss active weather using the military analogy of  opposing armies meeting at the battle front.   8.2.  Fronts.  are  boundaries  between  air  masses  with  temperature  and  density  differences  (Figure  8l.). The boundary or contrast  zone between two differing  air  masses  is  called  a front  with  the  air  mass  on  the  Earth\u2019s  surface  called  the  surface  front.  The  frontal  zone\u2019s  shape  is  determined  by  the  frontal  zone  type  and  the  extent  of  air  mass  differences.  Generally,  active  weather is focused along and on either side of a surface front. Likewise, most aviation weather  hazards are also found in the vicinity of fronts. In the mid-latitudes, fronts usually form between  tropical  and  polar  air  masses.  Frontal  Zones,  normally  many  miles  in  width,  are  most  easily  detected  when  the  air  masses  have  vastly  different  properties  (e.g.,  cold,  dry  air  from  Canada  colliding  with  warm,  moist  air  from  the  Gulf  of  Mexico).  Frontal  zones  are  more  difficult  to  locate  over  data  sparse  regions  like  the  ocean,  mountains  and  between  highly  modified  air  masses.  Advances  in  satellite  imagery  processes  and  interpretation  have  helped  meteorologists  better  locate  frontal  systems.  Meteorological  satellite  imagery  is  indispensable  in  data  sparse  regions.  If a flying unit  is  deployed to a data sparse  region,  the meteorologist can use satellite  imagery as the only tool to locate fronts and other active weather boundaries. Figure 8.2 shows  an  excellent  example  of  a  frontal  system  sprawling  thousands  of  miles  from  the  parent  low  pressure  system  located  in  the  North  Atlantic.    The  associated  cold  front,  warm  front,  and  occluded front are drawn.   Figure 8.1.  Frontal Zone.     \f  70    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 8.2.  Satellite Picture of a Cyclone in the North Atlantic.   8.3.  Types of Fronts.   8.3.1.  There are four basic types of fronts: warm, cold, stationary and occluded. Warm and  cold fronts are classified according to how the temperature of the air mass compares to the  surface  temperature  over  which  the  air  mass  passes.  A  stationary  front  generally  occurs  between  two  high  pressure  systems  and  normally  is  a  former  moving  front  which  lost  momentum and stalled. Occluded fronts result from either a faster moving warm or cold front  overtaking  a  slower  moving  front  with  the  surface-based  colder  air  forcing  the  warmer  air  aloft. On surface analysis charts, fronts are designated with color-coded lines; red for warm  fronts,  blue  for  cold  fronts,  purple  for  occluded  fronts,  and  alternating  red  and  blue  for  stationary fronts.  For black and white surface charts, designs (pips) on the line indicate the  front type and point in the direction the front is moving. Triangle shaped pips designate cold  fronts while half-circle shaped pips designate warm fronts. Mixtures of the pip arrangements  indicate either stationary or occluded fronts with stationary fronts designated with alternating  triangle and half-circle pips on both sides of a front. Occluded fronts use purple colored pips  with both pips on one side of the front. Figure 8.3 shows what the above fronts look like on a  surface chart.     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     71    Figure 8.3.  Types of Fronts.   8.3.2.  Typical or \u2015classic\u2016 weather patterns precede and follow fronts as they move through  an  area.  Approaching  warm  fronts  are  often  preceded  by  an  orderly  procession  of  high  clouds,  middle  clouds,  and  finally  the  extensive  lower  clouds  (Figure  8.4).  Additionally,  weather  typically  associated  with  particular  fronts  may  vary  according  to  geographic  location.  For  example,  the  northernmost  portion  of  a  wintertime  cold  front  can  have  snow  showers while the southern portion of the same front can spawn severe thunderstorms.   Figure 8.4.  Warm Front Clouds.   8.4.  Identifying a Front.   8.4.1.  Temperature  change  is  one  of  the  most  easily  recognized  features  when  locating  a  front  because  it  changes  the  most.  When  flying  through  a  front,  aircrews  notice  significant  changes  in  temperature,  especially  at  lower  altitudes.  The  rate  of  temperature  change  is  an  indicator  of  a  front\u2019s  intensity.  Abrupt  and  sizable  temperature  changes  often  accompany  strong  (narrow)  fronts.  Gradual  and  minor  changes  characterize  weak  or  diffuse  fronts.  Temperature changes are more pronounced in  the lower levels  than the  upper levels.  Thus,  for flight safety reasons, update the altimeter setting as often as practical when flying near a  front.  The  dew  point  temperature  gives  a  practical  measure  of  an  air  masses\u2019  moisture  content.  The  dew  point  and  temperature/dew  point  difference  varies  across  a  front.  The  \u2015difference,\u2016  called  the  dew  point  depression,  is  the  difference  between  the  free  air  temperature and the dew point temperature. The dew point depression helps identify the front  and  gives  a  clue  to  the  potential  for  cloudiness  and  fog.  The  smaller  the  dew  point       \f  72    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   depression,  the  more  moisture  an  air  mass  possesses  and  it  becomes  more  likely  that  condensation will occur.   8.4.2.  When  speaking  of  dew  point  temperature  changes  we  must  remain  representative  of  the seasonal changes.  Summer dew point temperatures will ultimately be higher than winter  dew  point  temperatures.    Remember  that  when  the  dew  point  temperature  and  the  ambient  temperature are nearly equal, the column of air will become saturated. Both temperatures and  dew  points  are  relatively  higher  behind  warm  fronts  and  often  result  in  considerable  cloudiness  and  restrictions  to  visibility.  In  the  summer,  higher  dew  points  are  a  good  indicator  of  showers  and  potentially  strong  thunderstorm  development.  When  monitoring  a  potentially  explosive  thunderstorm  situation,  weather  forecasters  often  focus  on  the  dew  point  temperature.  If  the  value  is  above  65oF,  the  potential  for  strong  thunderstorm  development is quite high. In wintertime, higher dew points indicate the potential for snow,  freezing  rain,  ice  pellets,  and  rain.  Higher  dew  points  aloft  indicate  a  potential  for  icing  hazards. This combined with air mass stability determines the type and severity of icing.   8.5.  Frontal Passage.   8.5.1.  Frontal  passage  is  evidenced  by  marked  changes  in  wind  direction  and  speed  at  the  Earth\u2019s  surface  and  aloft.  Wind  speed  is  often  variable  in  direction  and  usually  produce  higher prevailing winds and stronger gusts behind a cold front. Other times, the wind speed  may  approach  calm  until  the  actual  frontal  surface  passes  through  your  location.  Steady  southeasterly,  southerly  or  southwesterly  winds  precede  cold  frontal  passage  with  the  strongest  pre-frontal  winds  observed  just  before  cold  frontal  passage.  Cold  fronts  are  accompanied by gusty westerly, northwesterly to northerly winds. Again, wind strength is a  function  of  the  pressure  gradient  and  differences  in  the  air  mass  densities.  The  greater  the  difference, the stronger the winds will be. When flying from warm to cold air, the wind speed  increases abruptly since wind speeds are generally greater in a cold air mass.   8.5.2.  A front lies in a pressure trough, an area of lowest surface barometric pressure, with  the pressure higher on either side of the trough. Thus, the pressure usually decreases when a  front  approaches  and  rises  after  the  front  moves  through.  The  rate  of  barometric  pressure  change often accelerates as a front moves through. The change rate can be quite dramatic, up  to 0.10\u2016 Hg change per hour or more, especially when flying in the vicinity of strong winter  storms! Keep an eye on your altimeter and make sure it\u2019s current!   8.6.  Cold Front.   8.6.1.  A cold front is the leading edge of an advancing cold air mass. Colder air overtakes  and  wedges  underneath  the  warmer  air  forcing  the  warmer  air  aloft.  Surface  friction  slows  the air in contact with the surface, creating a bulge in the frontal slope. This tends to give the  front a steep slope near its leading edge (Figure 8.5). Cold frontal slopes average about 1:80  miles. This means that 80 miles behind the front\u2019s surface position, the frontal boundary is  about  one  mile  above  the  ground.  A  steep  sloped  front  (1:40),  results  in  a  narrow  band  of  active weather while a shallower sloped front (1:100), results in a wide band of weather.   \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     73    Figure 8.5.  Fast Moving Cold Front Runs Under Warmer Air.   8.6.2.  Cold fronts may  be accompanied by dramatic weather changes  and hazardous flying  weather.  Figure  8.2  is  an  example  of  what  a  cold  front,  warm  front,  and  occluded  front  would look like on a surface chart. There are two types of cold fronts: fast moving (Inactive  front) and slow moving (active front). In extreme cases, fast moving cold fronts can move at  50 kts, but normally average between 25-35 kts. The slow moving cold fronts average 10-20  kts. Cold fronts usually move faster in winter than in summer and are dependent upon the jet  stream strength and movement for surface speed.   8.6.3.  During winter, the cold front will dramatically affect those airfields in the vicinity of  water  bodies  downwind  from  the  front.  As  a  cold  front  with  its  colder,  drier  air,  picks  up  moisture from the unfrozen water bodies, the lower-level, moisture-laden air will precipitate  as  snow  as  the  air  is  forced  to  climb  higher  terrain.  When  you  are  flying  through  a  cold  frontal surface, the wind shift may be abrupt, and some form of heading change is generally  required.  The  wind  shift  occurs  at  the  location  of  air  mass  penetration  rather  than  at  the  surface  front.  Cold  fronts  slope  \u2015back\u2016  towards  colder  air.  This  means  that  when  you\u2019re  flying  through  a  frontal  surface,  frontal  passage  will  not  be  apparent  at  the  same  place  it  would be if you were on the ground (Figure 8.6). If you use the standard frontal slope ratio  of 1:80,  you will be approximately 80 miles on the cold air side of the surface front before  encountering the cold air one mile up in the atmosphere. This means if you are flying directly  towards the cold front from the \u2015back\u2016 side of the front, you will pass through the upper cold  front approximately 80 miles before you pass over the surface front. When cold fronts move  with  moderate  or  rapid  speed,  the  active  weather  band  is  generally  less  than  50  miles.  Ceilings  and  visibilities  will  quickly  decrease  usually  coinciding  with  the  onset  of  precipitation. If the front is a slow-moving cold front, the area of low ceilings and visibility  may  be  extensive  enough  to  seriously  affect  flight  operations  for  several  hours.  Even  with  slow  moving  cold  fronts,  the  frontal  precipitation  band  is  usually  relatively  narrow  (as  compared  to  a  warm  front).  This  is  particularly  true  if  the  precipitation  is  showery  in  character.     \f  74    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 8.6.  Wind shifts Associated with Flight Level Cold Frontal Boundaries.   8.7.  Squall Lines.   8.7.1.  Under  certain  atmospheric  conditions,  a  squall  line  composed  of  thunderstorms  may  develop 50 to 200 NM ahead of and parallel to a fast moving cold front. If a squall line does  develop, little activity usually occurs at the cold front. Thunderstorms along a squall line are  frequently similar to those along a cold front, but may be more violent. The cloud bases are  often  lower  and  the  tops  higher  than  with  most  other  thunderstorms.  The  most  severe  conditions (large hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes) are generally associated with squall  line thunderstorms. Squall lines are usually most intense during the late afternoon and early  evening  hours  just  after  maximum  daytime  heating.  Squall  lines  usually  form  rapidly,  and  sometimes  a  series  will  develop  ahead  of  the  cold  front.  Squall  lines  form  when  cold  air  downdrafts flowing ahead of the cold front lift warm, unstable air. The uplifted air develops  its  own  updrafts  and  downdrafts  and  starts  the  thunderstorm  development  cycle.  As  the  thunderstorms continue development, a squall line will form, often moving quickly attaining  forward speeds of up to 50 knots. Eventually the squall line loses its momentum and energy  and dissipates after a several hour life cycle. Sometimes a new squall line reforms and moves  through  approximately  the  same  location  of  the  dissipating  one.  Figure  8.7  illustrates  the  squall  line  formation  process.  While  squall  lines  frequently  accompany  cold  fronts,  the  existence of a front is not a prerequisite. Squall lines may accompany low pressure troughs or  lines  where  sea  breezes  converge  against  mountain  barriers.  Squall  line  flying  hazards  include turbulence (possibly extreme), wind shear, thunderstorms, lightning, heavy rain, hail,  icing, and possibly tornadoes. Other hazards are the strong, variable, gusty, low level winds  (wind shear) at the surface, around and under the thunderstorms and sudden altimeter setting  changes. The altimeter can change 0.06 to 0.12\u2016 Hg in a matter of minutes. For an example  of a squall line seen on radar, see Figure 8.8.     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     75    Figure 8.7.  Formation of a Squall Line."

            "text":"Figure 8.8.  Squall Line on RADAR.       \f  76    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   8.8.  Warm Front.   8.8.1.  A  warm  front  is  the  edge  of  an  advancing  warm  air  mass;  that  is,  warmer  air  overtaking  and  replacing  colder  air.  Since  cold  air  is  denser  than  warm  air,  the  cold  air  is  slow to retreat in advance of the overriding warm air. This produces a warm frontal slope that  extends ahead of the surface front and has a more gradual slope. Warm frontal slopes usually  average  about  1:200  mi.  If  the  advancing  warm  air  is  moist  and  stable,  stratiform  clouds  develop as shown in Figure 8.9. Precipitation increases gradually with the approach of this  type of warm front and usually continues until it passes. If the advancing warm air is moist  and unstable, as shown in Figure 8.10, altocumulus and cumulonimbus are embedded in the  cloud  masses  normally  accompanying  the  front.  The  presence  of  embedded  thunderstorms  may often be unknown to aircrews until they are encountered. Precipitation in advance of the  front is usually showery with periods of steady light rain. The widespread precipitation ahead  of a warm front is often accompanied by low stratus and fog. In this case, the precipitation  raises  the  moisture  content  of  the  cold  air  until  saturation  is  reached.  This  produces  low  ceilings and poor visibility covering thousands of square miles. When rain begins to fall from  warmer air above the front into the colder air below the frontal surface, ragged clouds (stratus  fractus) form in the cold air. These ominous looking clouds can cause very low ceilings and  often obscure higher terrain. Steady precipitation will provide a constant source of moisture  allowing the low stratus  clouds to  continuously form.  Ceilings are often in  the 300 to  900- foot range during steady, warm frontal rain situation. Just before the warm front passes your  station, ceilings and visibilities can drop to zero with drizzle and fog. The worst conditions  often occur in the winter when the ground is cold and the air is warm: the best scenario for  dense fog and low ceilings.   Figure 8.9.  Warm Front and Moist Stable Air.     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     77    Figure 8.10.  Warm Front and Moist Unstable Air.   8.8.2.  Depending on the depth and temperature of the cold layer below the warm layer, you  could  experience  drizzle,  rain,  freezing  drizzle,  freezing  rain,  ice  pellets,  snow,  or  a  combination  of  these.  Wintertime  warm  fronts  produce  the  greatest  variety  of  precipitation  types.  Figure  8.11  shows  the  various  precipitation  types  in  a  wintertime  warm  front  when  temperatures are near freezing. Some of the heaviest snowstorms form when warm air glides  over  the  colder  air  as  a  warm  front  approaches.  With  a  strong  low  pressure  system,  the  pressure gradient is strong enough to force large scale movements of air in both the vertical  and  horizontal  directions.  As  warmer,  moist  air  rises  and  condenses  heavy  snowfalls  can  result,  often  lasting  for  several  hours.  Many  an  airport  has  been  closed  for  long  periods  of  time  due  to  heavy  snowstorms  associated  with  warm  fronts.  If  the  warm  front  is  warm  enough and advances close to your location, the heavy snow will gradually transition to ice  pellets  and  rain  before  changing  to  all  rain.  Aloft,  conditions  are  ripe  for  formation  of  moderate to  severe clear icing and rime icing. On the ground, conditions  may be favorable  for  extended  bouts  of  freezing  rain  reducing  braking  action,  runway  condition  readings  (RCR), to \u201506\u2016 or less! Obtain the freezing level from your weather briefer and be observant  when  flying  around  and  above  the  freezing  level.  The  weather  forecaster  can  generally  forecast when icing potential is likely.   8.8.3.  Unfortunately,  pinpointing  exact  locations  of  icing  formation  is  very  difficult.  In  Figure  8.11,  snow  falls  from  the  part  of  the  cloud  with  freezing  temperatures  below  the  cloud.  Rain  will  fall  from  the  portion  of  the  cloud  which  is  above  freezing,  but  if  it  falls  through a layer of cold air it becomes supercooled and will freeze on contact with any cold  object  creating  freezing  rain.  As  you  fly  through  this  region,  the  type  of  precipitation  you  experience in the air will not necessarily match that falling on the ground. The form of the  precipitation reaching the ground depends on the thickness or depth of the cold air and warm  layers above that point on the ground. There is  a relatively narrow transition zone between  the snow and the  freezing rain  area.  In the upper portion  of this zone there is  a mixture of  freezing  rain  and  snow,  in  the  lower  levels  there  is  a  mixture  of  snow  and  ice  pellets.  Therefore,  when  flying  toward  the  front  in  the  lower  levels  of  the  cold  air  mass,  you  may  meet  snow,  snow  and  ice  pellets  mixed,  and  then  freezing  rain,  in  succession.  At  higher  levels,  but  still  in  the  cold  air,  you  will  not  encounter  ice  pellets.  The  sequence  of     \f  78    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   precipitation  will  be  reversed  if  you  are  flying  from  the  warm  to  the  cold  air  mass.  Warm  front icing conditions and other icing scenarios are covered in Chapter 11.   Figure 8.11.  Precipitation Types in Wintertime Warm Frontal Zone.   8.8.4.  Whether you fly through a warm front with stable or unstable air, the clouds gradually  descend  from  near  20,000  feet  to  6,500  feet  or  lower.  From  the  thick  altostratus  clouds,  intermittent light precipitation may be encountered. If the altostratus deck is still quite high,  this  precipitation  may  not  reach  the  ground.  As  flight  is  continued,  the  altostratus- altocumulus deck will lower and the precipitation will increase in intensity. Passage into the  warm air mass will be indicated by a rise in temperature and a wind shift, even though the  magnitude of this wind shift will be fairly small above 10,000 feet. The wind shift will occur  at  the  frontal  boundary,  which  may  not  coincide  with  the  surface  frontal  position.  Warm  frontal wind shift and its effects on your flight are as follows:   8.8.4.1.  The  outside  air  temperature  rises  when  you  have  passed  through  the  frontal  surface from the cold air side to the warm air side.   8.8.4.2.  The wind shift requires an alteration to the right, no matter which way  you are  flying through the front.   8.8.4.3.  The  wind  shift  will  be  most  noticeable  in  the  lower  levels,  especially  below  5,000 feet.   8.8.5.  While  flight  through  the  lower  levels  of  warm  front  isn\u2019t  completely  smooth,  a  turbulence  problem  arises  when  cumulonimbus  clouds  are  embedded  in  the  mainly  nimbostratus cloud deck. The flight planning difficulty is that embedded thunderstorms may  be  scattered  throughout  the  seemingly  solid  cloud  decks  and  you  have  no  way  of  knowing  exactly when or where you will encounter storms. If you must fly through IMC weather, use  all available resources (ATC, on board radar, etc.) to avoid embedded thunderstorms.     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     79    8.8.6.  Warm fronts have a very shallow slope of approximately 1:200 miles and the air mass  generally  doesn\u2019t  extend  as  far  up  in  the  atmosphere  as  a  cold  air  mass.  The  time  to  be  concerned  about  warm  frontal  wind  shear  is  6  to  12  hours  prior  to  a  warm  frontal  passage  (while the airfield is still in the cold air) and an hour after warm frontal passage.   8.8.7.  On the north side of warm frontal surfaces, especially in the vicinity of low pressure  centers,  low  level  convergence  can  cause  surface  winds  to  exceed  20  to  40  knots.  When  flying  south  through  the  warm  frontal  slope,  winds  can  shift  to  the  south-southwest  with  speeds  up  to  40  to  50  knots,  usually  from  near  ground  level  to  approximately  5,000  feet  AGL.  If  the  pressure  gradient  is  strong,  the  transition  from  northerly  component  winds  to  southerly  component  winds  can  be  abrupt.  This  strong  low  level  wind  pattern  is  called  the  \u2015low  level  jet  stream.\u2016  This  is  the  same  wind  pattern  which  is  often  associated  with  a  potential for severe weather. When penetrating this low level jet stream, you can experience  large changes in headwind or tailwind components below 1,000 feet AGL. Often low level  significant weather charts will forecast light to moderate turbulence with this situation.   8.9.  Stationary Front.   8.9.1.  Sometimes,  opposing  forces  exerted  by  adjacent  air  masses  are  such  that  the  frontal  surface between them shows little or no movement. In such cases, surface winds tend to blow  parallel to the front rather than against or away from it. This is called a stationary front, since  it  does  not  move  and  neither  air  mass  replaces  the  other.  Figure  8.12  depicts  a  stationary  front on the surface weather chart.   Figure 8.12.  Stationary Front as Shown on Surface Weather Chart.   8.9.2.  Although  there  is  no  movement  of  the  surface  position  of  the  stationary  front,  there  still is movement of air toward the front from either side of it. Warmer air will move towards  it generally from the south while colder air from the north will also move towards the front.  The clash of the two air masses will cause an active weather band to develop. The stronger  air  mass  controls  the  angle  of  the  air  flow  in  relation  to  the  front\u2019s  surface  position,  the  strength  of  the  up-gliding  wind,  and  determines  the  inclination  of  the  frontal  slope.  Fronts     \f  80    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   moving  less  than  5  kts  are  called  either  quasi-stationary  or  stationary.  Weather  conditions  occurring with stationary fronts are similar to those found with warm fronts but are usually  less  intense.  One  annoying  feature  of  the  stationary  front  is  that  the  weather  pattern  may  persist and hamper flights for several days. Stationary fronts can also be the focus of heavy  precipitation events and can result in local flooding over a period of time.   8.10.  Frontal Waves.   8.10.1.  Frontal  waves  are  primarily  the  result  of  the  interaction  of  two  air  masses;  they  usually form on slow-moving cold fronts or stationary fronts. During stage A of Figure 8.13,  the winds on both sides of the front blow parallel to the front. Small disturbances in the wind  pattern, as well as uneven local heating and irregular terrain may start a wave-like bend in the  front (B). These disturbances are not obvious on the weather chart. If this tendency persists  and the wave increases in size, a counterclockwise (cyclonic) circulation starts to form. One  section of the front begins moving as a warm front, while the section next to it begins moving  as a cold front (C). This deformation area is called a frontal wave. As the pressure at the peak  of  the  frontal  wave  falls  a  low-pressure  center  forms.  The  cyclonic  circulation  strengthens,  and the winds begin moving the fronts. The cold front moves faster than the warm front (D).   Figure 8.13.  Frontal Wave and Occlusion.   8.11.  Occlusions.   8.11.1.  When the cold front over takes the warm front, the two of them occlude.  During this  stage of development the cold front pushes the warm air aloft resulting in an occlusion (E) or     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     81    the  blocking  or  cutting  off  of  the  warm  air  from  the  Earth\u2019s  surface.  This  is  the  time  of  maximum  intensity  for  the  wave  cyclone.    The  occluded  front  will  exhibit  characteristics  from both the cold front and warm front. This reason is why the weather symbol depicting an  occlusion  is  depicted  as  a  combination  of  the  symbols  and  colors  of  the  warm  and  cold  fronts. The low pressure area at this stage will continue to deepen up to 12 to 24 hours, and  the frontal movement will slow as the occlusion continues to grow in length, (F).  During the  dissipation or dissolving stage the low pressure center of the system becomes cut-off and the  remnants  of  the  occlusion  begin  to  disappear  (G).  At  this  point,  a  new  frontal  wave  may  begin  to  form  at  the  location  of  the  triple  point  of  the  occlusion  (where  the  cold  front  and  warm front meet) or along the long westward-trailing portion of the cold front (G) that has  elongated and become more stationary.  Figure 8.14 shows the development of an occlusion  depicted on a map with the corresponding cross section profile to show how an occlusion is  portrayed in the vertical.   Figure 8.14.  Occlusion Development and Cross- Profile.   8.11.2.  There are two types of occluded fronts: warm and cold occlusions. The portion of the  occluded  front  which  intersects  the  Earth\u2019s  surface  determines  whether  the  occlusion  is  a  cold or warm occluded front.  In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is  colder than the cool air ahead of the warm front, and plows under both air masses. In a warm  occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is not as cool as the cold air ahead of the  warm front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air.  Figure 8.15 shows     \f  82    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   an examples of a cold frontal occlusion and a warm frontal occlusion. The figure also shows  the  relative  positions  of  the  cold  air,  cool  air  and  warm  air  portions  of  the  occlusion.  The  location  of  the  occlusion  is  significant  to  aircrews  because  the  most  severe  weather  (including low ceilings and visibilities) is generally located in an area 100 NM south to 300  NM north of the frontal intersection.   Figure 8.15.  Frontal Occlusion Profiles.   8.11.3.  Since  occlusions  result  from  one  frontal  system  overtaking  another,  occlusions  combine  the  weather  of  both  warm  and  cold  fronts  into  one  extensive  system.  A  line  of  showers and thunderstorms typical of cold fronts merges with the warm front\u2019s low ceilings.  Precipitation  and  low  visibilities  are  widespread  on  either  side  of  the  occlusion\u2019s  surface  position.  In  addition,  strong  winds  occur  around  an  intense  low  pressure  center  at  the  occlusion\u2019s northern end. Aircrews should be aware of rapidly changing weather conditions  in occlusions and that changes are most dramatic during the initial stages of development. If  you are flying toward an approaching occlusion, the cloud pattern is very similar to that of a  warm front. However, the weather is more complex because part of the occluded weather is  characteristic of a cold front. If you approach an occlusion from behind, the cloud structure  may resemble a cold front, but the effects on flight are different. In addition to the problems  associated with a cold front, there are the problems of the extensive cloud deck which may  lie  ahead  of  the  base  of  the  warm  air.  If  flight  is  conducted  through  the  system  at  such  an  altitude that you pass below the base of the trough, you would expect one wind shift. If you  fly  at  higher  altitudes,  there  will  be  two  wind  shifts  because  you  must  pass  through  two  frontal surfaces (see Figure 8.6).   8.11.4.  Aircrew Notes.   8.11.4.1.  Be  extremely  cautious  when  flying  in  the  vicinity  of  rough  terrain  around  frontal boundaries. Surface-based directional and speed changes can be quite abrupt and     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     83    terrain dependent. For instance, surface winds funneled down valleys result in stronger  than expected wind speeds when the winds spill out over a nearby airfield.   8.11.4.2.  Strong  winds  moving  perpendicular  to  mountain  tops  will  enhance  mountain  wave turbulence conditions during and after frontal passage.   8.11.4.3.  Be  especially  alert  for  wind  shear.  Rapid  changes  in  wind  speed  and/or  direction create wind shear, which is extremely hazardous especially when departing or  approaching  an  airfield.    For  example,  winds  at  220  degrees  at  10  knots  immediately  ahead  of  cold  front  may  be  displaced  by  winds  330  degrees  at  20  knots  gusting  to  30  knots behind the cold front. Wind shear is further discussed in Chapter 10.   8.11.4.4.  Crosswinds  are  another  hazard  frequently  experienced  with  frontal  passage.  Runway orientation is the key in determining whether or not you will experience sudden  crosswinds. An in-depth discussion of wind hazards follows in Chapter 9.   \f  84    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Chapter 9   TURBULENCE   9.1.  Introduction.  Turbulence  is  one  of  the  most  unexpected  aviation  hazards  to  fly  through,  and  one  of  the  most  difficult  hazards  to  forecast.  Severe  and  extreme  turbulence  have  been  known to cause extensive structural damage to B-52s, with lesser cases resulting in compressor  stalls,  flameouts,  and  injury  to  crew  members  and  passengers.  From  minor  bumps  to  severe  mountain  wave  turbulence,  it  comes  in  many  forms  and  is  usually  worst  during  the  winter  months.  The  National  Transportation  Safety  Board  estimates  that  turbulence  accounts  for  approximately 71% of all weather-related accidents and incidents involving aviation. The cost to  U.S. airlines due to injuries, cabin and aircraft damage, flight delays, and time lost to inspection  and maintenance is substantial, with estimates in the $150-$500 million per year range.   9.2.  Turbulence Causes.   9.2.1.  Turbulence  is  caused  by  abrupt,  small-scale  variations  in  wind  speed  and  direction.  Upper  level  turbulence  is  associated  with  variations  in  the  jet  stream  winds.  It  is  mainly  found in curved jet stream segments associated with troughs, ridges, closed upper level lows,  and rapidly developing surface lows. Classifying turbulence intensity is difficult and is often  a  function  of  a  pilot\u2019s  flying  experience  and  how  much  the  pilot  has  been  exposed  to  turbulence.  In  addition,  the  flier\u2019s  assessment  of  turbulence  is  influenced  by  the  length  of  time  and  the  severity  of  the  turbulence.  Most  of  all,  the  type  of  aircraft  and  the  aircraft\u2019s  speed  and  weight  determines  how  a  crew  will  experience  turbulence.  Severe  turbulence  reported by a C-172 may be light to occasionally moderate when experienced by a C-5 crew.   9.2.2.  Aircrew Note.   9.2.2.1.  The  above  problem  is  further  complicated  because  air  turbulence  clues  aren\u2019t  plentiful,  occur  at  infrequent  intervals,  and  are  often  reported  at  widely  separated  locations.  Thus,  forecasters  are  very  dependent  on  timely,  accurate  pilot  reports  (PIREPs).  In  fact,  it  may  be  your  turbulence  report  which  triggers  a  weather  service  turbulence  advisory  for  your  fellow  fliers.  Always  include  your  aircraft  location,  time,  turbulence intensity, flight level, aircraft type, and duration of turbulence when providing  a PIREP.   9.3.  Categories of Turbulence.   9.3.1.  Turbulence  is  categorized  as  light,  moderate,  severe  and  extreme.  Each  category  is  defined in  terms  which are perceived by the pilot  in  terms  of effects  on the aircraft and its  occupants. Weather forecasters use moderate or greater when forecasting turbulence on their  hazard  charts.  The  weather  community  intends  for  turbulence  reports  to  be  used  in  two  important  ways:  (1) pilot  reports of turbulence received from  one type of aircraft are to  be  used to predict how the pilot of another similar aircraft will experience the same turbulence  and  (2)  Air  Force  weather  briefers  are  to  brief  forecasted  turbulence  in  a  manner  that  will  allow them to present these same turbulence categories to the pilot. This allows consistency  in transmitting turbulence information and allows aviators to anticipate a particular level of  forecasted turbulence.   \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     85    9.3.2.  Because of the different effects of turbulence on different types of aircraft, the DOD  Flight Information Handbook, Section C, lists turbulence reporting categories. The tables are  based on intensity, aircraft reaction, and the reaction within the aircraft.   9.3.2.1.  Light  turbulence:  Momentarily  causes  slight,  erratic  changes  in  altitude  and/or  attitude (pitch, roll, and yaw).   9.3.2.2.  Light chop: Slight, rapid and somewhat rhythmic bumpiness without appreciable  changes in altitude or attitude.   9.3.2.3.  Moderate  turbulence:  Similar  to  light  turbulence  but  of  greater  intensity.  Changes in altitudes and/or attitude occur but the aircraft remains in positive control at all  times. It usually causes variations in indicated airspeed.   9.3.2.4.  Moderate  chop:  Turbulence  similar  to  light  chop  but  of  greater  intensity  and  causes rapid bumps or jolts without appreciable changes in aircraft altitude or attitude.   9.3.2.5.  Severe  turbulence:  Causes  large  abrupt  changes  in  altitude  and/or  attitude.  It  usually  causes  large  variation  in  indicated  airspeed.  Aircraft  control  becomes  very  difficult.   9.3.2.6.  Extreme  turbulence:  Aircraft  violently  tossed  around  with  control  virtually  impossible.  There  are  large,  sudden  changes  in  altitude  and/or  attitude.  Extreme  turbulence may cause structural damage.   9.4.  Causes of Turbulence.   9.4.1.  Knowledge of turbulence  causes  and formation locations help  you to  minimize  your  exposure to turbulence or avoid it altogether. This chapter discusses the following turbulence  types:   9.4.2.  Convective Turbulence: Caused by alternating currents of warm air rising and cooler  air descending.   9.4.3.  Mechanical  Turbulence:  Caused  by  wind  flowing  over  obstructions, or by a marked change in wind speed or direction over a short distance.   irregular   terrain  or   9.4.4.  Mountain Wave Turbulence: Caused by air blowing perpendicular across the top of a  mountain range.   9.4.5.  High  Altitude  Turbulence:  Variations  in  wind  speed  and  direction  principally  in  the  vicinity  of  the  jet  stream  and  occurs  above  10,000  feet.  This  is  commonly  called  clear  air  turbulence (CAT) because of scant, visible evidence of its existence.   9.4.6.  Wake Vortex Turbulence: Generated by every aircraft in flight at its wing tips.   9.5.  Effects on Aircraft.   9.5.1.  Turbulence  causes  a  variety  of  effects  on  aircraft  ranging  from  gentle  jostling  to  structural  damage.  Another  important  aspect  of  turbulence  is  that  it  can  produce  adverse  effects on the aircrew. Aviation medicine and human factor research has shown that a severe  turbulence  environment  can  cause  a  compromise  of  aircrew  performance  in  the  following  ways:   9.5.2.  Delays decision time.   \f  86    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   9.5.3.  Produces involuntary control movements which may not be obvious to the aircrew.   9.5.4.  Produces sensory illusion.   9.5.5.  Makes reading instruments difficult.   9.6.  Convective Turbulence.   9.6.1.  Convective  currents  usually  cause  turbulence,  especially  at  low  altitudes.  These  currents  are  localized  vertical  air  movements,  both  ascending  and  descending.  For  every  rising current, there is a compensating downward current. The downward currents occur over  a  broader  area  than  the  rising  currents,  therefore  having  a  slower  vertical  speed  than  the  rising currents. Convective currents are most active on warm summer afternoons with light  winds.  Heated  surface  air  rises  creating  a  shallow,  unstable  layer.  As  surface  heating  increases, convection increases in strength and rises to greater heights. Barren surfaces such  as  sandy  or  rocky  wasteland  and  plowed  fields  become  hotter  than  open  water  or  ground  covered with vegetation (Figure 9l). The uneven heating of the surface results in rising and  sinking  air  currents.  Because  of  this,  the  strength  of  the  convective  currents  varies  considerably  within  short  distances.  Figures  9.2  and  Figure  9.3  illustrate  this  effect  on  an  aircraft  approaching  an  airport.  Winds  and  light  turbulence  that  develop  in  hilly  and  mountainous terrain due to differential heating are of particular importance for light aircraft,  helicopters, and low-level operations. In mountainous areas where the performance of some  fixed wing aircraft or helicopters is marginal, the location of upslope and down-slope winds  can  be  critical.  As  air  moves  upward,  it  cools  as  the  convective  current  continues  upward,  continually  cooling,  until  it  reaches  a  level  where  its  temperature  is  the  same  as  the  surrounding air. If it cools to saturation, a cloud forms. Aircrews should associate cumulus  and cumulonimbus clouds with thermal turbulence. Turbulence may be light to moderate in  or beneath the clouds, but the air is generally smooth above them (Figure 9.4). If the air is  too dry, aircrews may have no turbulence indications until they encounter it. Just be aware of  convective  turbulence  during  sunny,  hot,  dry  days.  Aircraft  response  to  turbulence  varies  with  turbulence  intensity  and  aircraft  characteristics  such  as  airspeed,  weight,  design,  wing  loading, and pilot technique. At higher speeds, turbulence places more stress on aircraft and  aircrew alike. At slower airspeeds, aircraft control is reduced and becomes more sluggish. To  minimize the effects of convective turbulence, fly above the turbulent layer, tighten your seat  belt and shoulder harness, and fly the turbulence airspeed recommended by your Dash 1.   \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     87    Figure 9.1.  Strength of Convective Currents varies with Composition of Surface.   Figure 9.2.  Updrafts May Cause Pilots to Overshoot.       \f  88    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 9.3.  Downdrafts May Cause Pilots to Undershoot.   Figure 9.4.  Avoid Convective Currents by Flying Above Cumulus Clouds.   9.7.  Mechanical Turbulence.   9.7.1.  Mechanical  turbulence  occurs  when  air  near  the  surface  flows  over  rough  terrain  or  other  obstructions.  Obstacles  such  as  trees,  buildings,  hills,  and  mountains  transform  the  normal wind flow into a complicated snarl of eddies (Figure  9.5). These eddies are carried  along  with  the  general  wind  flow;  their  size  and  extent  affects  the  flying  characteristics  of  aircraft.  The  degree  of  mechanical  turbulence  depends  on  the  roughness  of  the  terrain  or  obstructions, wind speed, and air mass stability. The higher the wind speed or the rougher the  surface, the greater the turbulence intensity will be. Unstable air allows larger eddies to form,  but  the  instability  breaks  up  these  eddies  more  quickly,  while  in  stable  air  they  dissipate"

            "text":"AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     89    slowly.  Wind  variability  near  the  ground  is  an  extremely  important  consideration  during  takeoff  and  landing,  especially  for  light  aircraft.  Strong,  gusty  winds  have  caused  many  aircraft  accidents.  Aircrews  landing  at  airports  where  large  hangars  or  other  buildings  are  located near the runways should be alert for formation of turbulent wind eddies as shown in  Figure  9.6.  If  the  wind  is  light,  eddies  tend  to  remain  as  rotating  pockets  of  air  near  the  windward and leeward sides of the buildings. If the wind speed exceeds about 20 knots, the  flow  may  be  broken  up  into  irregular  eddies  which  are  carried  a  sufficient  distance  downstream  to  create  a  hazard  in  the  landing  area.  The  IFR  en-route  supplement  should  describe  crosswind  and  turbulence  problems  as  appropriate  in  the  remarks  section  of  the  airfield  entry.  For  example,  Offutt  AFB  has  in  their  remarks  section  \u2015apch  end  turbulence  and hi variable crosswinds dur S to SW sfc winds\u2016.   9.7.2.  When  winds  blow  across  rugged  hills  or  mountains,  the  resulting  turbulence  may  increase  as  the  wind  speed  increases.  Exercising  caution  is  necessary  when  crossing  mountain ranges under strong wind conditions. Severe downdrafts can be expected on the lee  side as illustrated in Figure 9.7 These downdrafts can be dangerous and can place an aircraft  in  a  position  from  which  it  may  not  be  able  to  recover.  Aircrews  should  allow  for  this  condition when approaching mountain ridges against the wind. If the wind is strong and the  ridges  pronounced,  pilots  should  cross  obstructions  at  higher  than  normal  altitudes.  It  is  important  to  climb  to  the  crossing  altitude  well  before  reaching  the  mountains  to  avoid  having to climb (or, what is worse, trying unsuccessfully to climb) in a persistent downdraft.  Attempting  to  cross  at  a  lower  altitude  will  also  subject  the  aircraft  to  much  greater  turbulence and sudden crosswinds caused by winds blowing suddenly parallel to the valley  instead  of  the  prevailing  direction.  When  the  wind  blows  across  a  valley  or  canyon,  a  downdraft occurs on the lee side, while an updraft results on the windward side (Figure 9.8).  If flight through the canyon is required, the safest path is to fly near the side of the pass or  canyon, on the updraft side, which affords an upslope wind, since additional lift is provided.   \f  90    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 9.5.  Surface Obstructions Cause Eddies and Other Irregular Wind Movements.   Figure 9.6.  Buildings Near Landing Areas May Cause Turbulence.       \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     91    Figure 9.7.  Wind Flow over Mountain Ranges Produces Turbulence.   9.8.  Terrain Turbulence.   9.8.1.  If the wind blows across a narrow canyon or gorge, it will veer down into the canyon  (Figure 9.8). Turbulence will be found near the middle and downward side of the canyon or  gorge.  Aircrews  should  exercise  caution  during  flight  on  the  downwind  side  of  narrow  canyons, because winds may cause rates of descent which exceed the aircraft\u2019s ability to out- climb.   Figure 9.8.  In a Valley or Canyon, Safest Path is on Upslope Wind Side.       \f  92    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   9.8.2.  The mountains funnel winds into passes and valleys, thus increasing wind speeds and  intensifying  turbulence.  Funnel  winds  blow  out  of  mountain  valleys  and  toward  flat  areas,  reaching  speeds  of  up  to  80  knots  and  creating  hazardous  shear  and  turbulent  conditions.  Figure 9.9 illustrates the funnel wind effect. In this case, the terrain is such that the wind is  channeled through a narrow space where it is  accelerated and then spills out  into  the flight  path  of  aircraft  as  happens  at  Hill  AFB,  UT.  This  creates  low-level  wind  shear  that  is  different in origin from the wind shear associated with downbursts and microbursts.   Figure 9.9.  Winds Funneled through Mountain Valleys Create High Winds.   9.9.  Mountain Wave Turbulence.   9.9.1.  When  stable  (non-convective)  air  blows  across  a  mountain  range,  a  phenomenon  known as mountain wave turbulence may occur. A wave condition usually develops when a  component of wind flowing perpendicular to the top of the mountain exceeds 25 knots and an  inversion exists within 2,000 feet of the mountain top. Although the actual wind direction can  vary somewhat and still cause a wave, the strongest waves occur with a strong, perpendicular  flow.  The  waves,  which  resemble  ripples  formed  downstream  from  a  rock  in  a  swiftly  flowing  river,  remain  nearly  stationary  while  the  wind  blows  through  them.  The  characteristics of a typical mountain wave are shown in Figure 9.10. Waves such as these are  commonly  associated  with  high  mountain  ranges,  but  it  has  been  established  that  any  mountain range or ridge line is capable of producing wave phenomena.     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     93    Figure 9.10.  Typical Cloud Formation, Main Updraft and Downdraft in Mountain Wave.   9.9.2.  The  most  dangerous  features  of  the  mountain  wave  are  the  extreme  turbulence  and  very high velocity updrafts and downdrafts on the lee side of the mountain  range.  In some  cases, associated areas of updrafts and downdrafts may extend up to 70,000 feet and as far as  300 miles downstream  from  the mountain  range. The amplitude and intensity of the waves  decrease the further downstream they occur.   9.9.3.  While  clouds  are  usually  present  to  warn  aircrews  of  mountain  wave  activity,  it  is  possible  for  wave  action  to  take  place  when  the  air  is  too  dry  to  form  clouds.  If  the  descending  branch  of  wave  activity  immediately  to  the  lee  of  the  mountain  range  is  characterized by dry air that is warming rapidly via compression, cloud free areas known as  foehn  gaps  may  occur  downwind  of  the  mountains.    These  are  often  evident  in  satellite  imagery, and will appear as a clear area just to the lee of the mountain range where the phase  of the mountain wave is neutral.  Foehn gaps are indicators of potentially severe turbulence.   9.9.4.  Key  wave  turbulence  cloud  types  are  cap  clouds,  rotor  clouds,  and  altocumulus  standing lenticular clouds. Characteristic cloud forms, peculiar to  wave action, still provide  the  best  means  for  identifying  the  presence  of  the  wave.  The  weather  forecaster  can  use  satellite imagery to locate visible turbulence cloud signatures such as those evident in Figure  9.11.  Clouds  aligned  parallel  with  mountain  ranges  signal  the  presence  of  turbulence  and  extend hundreds of miles downstream.     \f  94    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 9.11.  Mountain Waves.   9.9.4.1.  Cap  Cloud.  The  cap  cloud  is  a  low  hanging  cloud  with  its  base  near  the  mountain  top  and  at  times  obscuring  the  mountain  peak.  Most  of  the  cloud  is  on  the  windward side, while on the leeward side, the cloud  looks like a wall hanging over the  edge with fingers pointing down the slope.   9.9.4.2.  Rotor  Cloud.  The  rotor  cloud  gives  a  visible  appearance  of  turbulence.  The  rotor cloud  looks like a  line of  cumulus  clouds  parallel  to the ridge line (Figure  9.12).  The cloud is usually stationary and is constantly forming and dissipating on the lee side  with  updrafts  and  downdrafts  of  up  to  5,000  feet  per  minute.  The  rotation  of  the  cloud  may  not  be  apparent  to  the  crew  member.  The  most  dangerous  features  of  mountain  waves are the turbulence in and below the rotor clouds and the downdrafts just to the lee  of the mountain ridges and to the lee of the rotor clouds.     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     95    Figure 9.12.  Rotor Clouds.   9.9.4.3.  Altocumulus Standing Lenticular Cloud. The standing lenticular cloud is lens- shaped and is probably the most frequent cloud associated with mountain waves (Figure  9.13).  It,  like  the  rotor,  is  stationary,  and  constantly  forms  in  bands  parallel  to  the  mountain at fairly regularly-spaced intervals on the leeward side. The standing lenticular  cloud  is  usually  found  above  14,000  feet  and  can  form  multiple  layers  at  differing  heights. The area identified by lenticular clouds is usually turbulent, no matter if they are  smooth or ragged in appearance.   9.9.5.  Barometric  pressure  is  considerably  lowered  in  the  mountain  wave  because  of  the  Venturi  effect  of  high  winds  over  an  obstruction.  Therefore,  significant  pressure  altimeter  errors are associated with the mountain wave. The maximum error can be as much as 2,500  feet  if  a  strong  wave  is  in  progress.  Aircrews  should  avoid  flight  into  areas  of  suspected  mountain wave conditions due to this error.     \f  96    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 9.13.  Standing Lenticular Clouds Associated with a Mountain Wave.   9.9.6.  Aircrew Notes.   9.9.6.1.  If  flight  into  the  area  must  be  made,  the  following  safeguards  should  be  followed:   9.9.6.1.1.  Avoid  the  cap,  rotor,  and  lenticular  clouds  since  they  can  often  contain  severe to extreme turbulence.   9.9.6.1.2.  As a minimum, fly at  a level  which is  at  least 50 percent  higher than  the  height  of  the  mountain  range.  This  procedure  will  not  keep  the  aircraft  out  of  turbulence,  but  provides  a  margin  of  safety  if  a  strong  downdraft  is  encountered  (Figure 9.14).   9.9.6.1.3.  Approach the mountain range at a 45o angle, so that a quick turn can be  made away from the ridge if a severe downdraft is encountered.   9.9.6.1.4.  Expect pressure altimeter errors. Altimeters may indicate 2,500 feet higher  than actual altitude.   9.9.6.1.5.  Follow additional Dash 1 procedures concerning flight speeds and control  settings.     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     97    Figure 9.14.  Mountain Turbulence Avoidance.   9.10.  Clear Air Turbulence (CAT).   9.10.1.  The tropopause is  often a region  of turbulence because of the marked variations in  vertical motions which occur in, at, or below it. The tropopause is often devoid of clouds, so  that turbulence encountered there will frequently be classified as clear air turbulence. Earlier  we  discussed  the  tropopause  is  higher  at  the  equator  than  at  the  poles.  However,  there  are  generally two breaks in the tropopause--one between the arctic and polar air masses, and one  between  the  polar  and  tropical  air  masses  (Figure  9.15).  It  is  where  these  breaks  in  the  tropopause appear that a very important flight factor can be found--the jet stream.     \f  98    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 9.15.  Location of Polar/Subtropical Jet Streams in Relation to Tropopause.   9.11.  Jet Streams and CAT.   9.11.1.  Jet  streams  were  already  discussed  in  Chapter  5,  but  because  they  often  produce  CAT,  they  are  briefly  mentioned  here  as  well.  In  rare  occasions  Wind  speeds  within  jet  streams may sometimes reach 300 kts (although very rarely), but generally are between 100  and  150  knots.    Such  strong  wind  speeds,  along  with  the  potential  presence  of  mountain  barriers  or  instability  aloft,  are  often  conducive  to  moderate  to  severe  CAT  at  flight  level.   This may force aircrews to change course or adjust altitude.  The existence of jet streams at  operational  altitudes  requires  additional  aircrew  flight  planning  consideration.  The  greater  headwind component for westbound aircraft will increase fuel consumption and may require  additional alternates along the route.   9.12.  Polar Front Jet (PFJ) Stream.   9.12.1.  In  Figure  9.16,  notice  that  the  highest  wind  speeds  and  probable  associated  turbulence  in  the  polar  front  jet  stream  is  found  about  5,000  feet  below  the  tropical  tropopause and near the end of the polar tropopause. Also notice that the rate of decrease of  wind  speed  is  much  greater  on  the  polar  side  than  on  the  equatorial  side.  Therefore,  the  magnitude of the wind shear is greater on the polar side than on the equatorial side. If a polar  front jet becomes indistinct, another reforms in a few days or so, and more than one jet can  exist  at  the  same  time.  There  is  hardly  a  day  in  the  colder  months  without  at  least  one  jet  stream, and often two or more, meandering over the United States.     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     99    Figure 9.16.  Areas of Probable Turbulence in Jet Stream.   9.12.2.  The rapid change of wind speed within a short distance of the jet core is particularly  significant. The vertical shear is generally close to the same intensity both above and below  the core, and it may be many times stronger than the horizontal shear; the horizontal shear on  the  cold  air  side  of  the  core  is  stronger  than  on  the  warm  air  side.  You  can  use  this  information to adjust your flight to obtain an increased tail wind or a decreased head wind.  The occurrence of CAT can extend to levels in excess of 60,000 feet, and can be associated  with  other  windflow  patterns  which  produce  shears.  A  sharp  trough  aloft,  especially  one  moving  at  a  greater  speed  than  20  kts,  can  have  clear  air  turbulence  in  or  near  the  trough,  even though wind speeds can be rather low as compared with the speeds near the jet stream.  However, the winds on opposite sides of the trough can have a difference of 90o or more in  direction  (Figure  9.17A).  CAT  can  occur  in  the  circulation  around  a  closed  low  aloft,  particularly  if  the  flow  is  merging  or  splitting  (Figure  9.17B)  and  is  to  the  northeast  of  a  cutoff low aloft (Figure 9.17C).   9.13.  Aircrew Notes.   9.13.1.  If jet stream turbulence is encountered with direct tail winds or head winds, a turn to  the  south  in  the  northern  hemisphere  will  place the  aircraft  in  a  more  favorable  area.  If  a  turn is not feasible because of airway restrictions, a climb or descent to the next flight level  will usually result in smoother air.   9.13.2.  Jet  stream  CAT  often  occurs  in  patches  averaging  2,000  feet  deep,  20  miles  wide,  and 50 miles long.   9.13.3.  If  jet  stream  turbulence  is  encountered  in  a  crosswind,  it  is  not  so  important  to  change course or flight level. However, if it is desired to traverse the CAT area more quickly,  either  climb  or  descend  after  watching  the  temperature  gauge  for  a  minute  or  two.  If  the  temperature  is  rising--climb;  if  it  is  falling--descend.  This  maneuver  will  prevent  following  the  sloping  tropopause  or  frontal  surface  and  thereby  staying  in  the  turbulent  area.  If  the  temperature remains the same, you can either climb or descend.   9.13.4.  When  anticipating  or  encountering  CAT,  turbulence- penetration  airspeed  for  your  aircraft  and  tighten  your  seat  belt  and  shoulder  harness.  Ordinarily,  this  will  reduce  the  effect  of  turbulence.  However,  if  the  intensity  of  the  turbulence requires further action, climb, descend, and/or change course to exit the turbulent   fly  the  recommended     \f  100    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   zone, using the information provided by the weather forecaster during the preflight weather  briefing  or  pilot-to-metro  services.  Make  very  gradual  climbs,  descents,  and  turns  to  minimize additional stress on the aircraft. Finally, give PIREPs as soon as practical to alert  fellow aviators of CAT and other dangerous weather.   Figure 9.17.  Wind Patterns Associated with High Level CAT.   9.14.  Low-Level Jet Stream.   9.14.1.  A low level jet stream is a \u2015sheet\u2016 of strong winds sometimes a thousand miles long,  hundreds of miles wide and hundreds of feet thick. It generally forms over large expanses of  flat terrain and develops in response to a strong east-west pressure gradient. The favored US  location is in the Midwest and Great Plains when a High pressure cell is over the east coast  and a Low pressure system forms on the east side of the Rocky Mountains. Winds are usually  from the south to southwest with velocities up to 60 knots at only 2000 to 6000 feet AGL.  Once again, it\u2019s the difference in wind speeds above and below the inversion that causes the  wind shear and turbulence. The level of maximum wind varies from about 700 feet to 2,000  feet above the ground. Wind speeds typically vary from 0-8 knots at  ground level to 25-40  knots  at  the  jet  maximum,  dropping  to  the  wind  speeds  normally  expected  (15-30  knots)  1,000 feet  or so above the maximum  wind (see  Figures 9.18  and Figure  9.19).  Low level  jets  are  one  of  the  main  causes  of  hazardous  low  level  wind  shear.  In  extreme  cases,  the  maximum winds can be in excess of 65 knots with shears of 10 knots or more per 100 feet  just  above  and  below  the  jet  core.  At  times  when  the  morning  inversion  breaks,  the  strong  winds that were just above the inversion lower to the surface very quickly.     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     101    Figure 9.18.  Wind Profile of Nocturnal Low level Jet.   Figure 9.19.  Meteogram showing Low Level Jet.   9.15.  Wake Turbulence.   9.15.1.  Every aircraft in flight generates a pair of counter-rotating vortices trailing from the  wing  tips  (Figure  9.20).  Many  large  jets  generate  vortices  exceeding  the  roll  capability  of  smaller  aircraft.  Further,  turbulence  generated  within  the  vortices  can  damage  aircraft  components  and  equipment  if  encountered  at  close  range.  The  strength  of  the  vortex  is       \f  102    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   governed primarily by the weight, speed, and wing shape of the generating aircraft. The basic  factor is weight, and vortex strength increases with increases in weight and span loading. The  greatest  vortex  strength  occurs  when  the  aircraft  is  HEAVY,  CLEAN,  and  SLOW.  Vortex  tangential velocities have been recorded up to 130 kts. A serious wake encounter could result  in structural damage. The primary hazard is loss of control because of induced roll (Figure  9.21).  The  capability  of  counteracting  this  roll  depends  on  the  span  and  counter-control  responsiveness  of  the  encountering  aircraft.  Where  the  wing  span  and  ailerons  of  larger  aircraft extend beyond the vortex, counter-control is usually effective and the induced roll is  minimal.   Figure 9.20.  Counter Rotating Vortices.   Figure 9.21.  Induced Roll.   9.15.2.  Trailing  vortex  wakes  have  certain  characteristics  which  the  aircrew  can  use  to  visualize their location and avoid them:       \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     103    9.15.2.1.  Vortex  generation  starts  with  rotation  when  the  nose-wheel  lifts  off  and  ends  when the nose-wheel touches down on landing.   9.15.2.2.  Vortex  circulation  is  outward,  upward,  and  around  the  wing  tip.  Core  sizes  range from 25 to 50 feet and stay close together until dissipation (Figure 9.22).   9.15.2.3.  Vortices sink immediately at a rate of 400 to 500 feet/minute and level off 800  to 900 feet below the flight path. Pilots should fly at or above a preceding aircraft\u2019s flight  path.   9.15.2.4.  When vortices sink into ground effect, they move laterally on the ground at  a  speed of about 5 kts.   9.15.2.5.  Cross-winds  will  influence  the  lateral  movement  of  the  upwind  vortex  and  increase  movement  of  the  downwind  vortex.  Aircrews  should  be  alert  to  heavy  jets  upwind.   9.15.2.6.  Tail-wind conditions can move the vortices forward into the touchdown zone.   9.15.2.7.  Vortices persist longer during inversions. When such conditions exist, aircrews  should request additional aircraft separation.   Figure 9.22.  Vortex Circulation.   9.15.3.  Helicopter-hovering can generate a down-wash from its main rotor(s) similar to the  prop-blast of conventional aircraft. In forward flight, this energy is transformed into a pair of  trailing vortices similar to wing tip vortices of fixed wing aircraft (Figure  9.23). However,  the  vortex  circulation  is  outward,  upward,  around,  and  away  from  the  main  rotor(s)  in  all  directions. Pilots of small aircraft and helicopters should avoid both the vortices and down- wash of a heavy helicopter.   9.15.4.  Airfield traffic controllers will separate IFR aircraft from heavy jets or large aircraft,  but  VFR  aircraft  must  provide  their  own  separation  from  heavy/large  aircraft.  But,  ultimately, it is  the aircrew\u2019s responsibility to  anticipate and avoid  areas  of possible vortex  wake turbulence.   9.15.5.  Aircrew Notes.     \f  104    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   9.15.5.1.  The  following  vortex  avoidance  procedures  are  recommended  for  the  various  situations:   9.15.5.1.1.  Enroute--fly at or above a large aircraft\u2019s flight path.   9.15.5.1.2.  Ensure adequate distance exists behind  landing heavies, or land beyond  the heavies\u2019 touchdown point if sufficient runway remains.   9.15.5.1.3.  Landing  or  departing  behind  a  departing  large  aircraft--land  or  rotate  prior to the heavy aircraft\u2019s rotation point.   Figure 9.23.  Helicopter Vortices.     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     105    Chapter 10   WINDSHEAR   10.1.  Introduction.  Flight crews must gather all available information to assist them in making  informed  decisions  when  flying  in  windshear  environments.  Recognizing  windshear,  using  available  cockpit  instruments,  and  using  effective  crew  coordination  procedures  are  the  first  steps  in  handling  this  potentially  lethal  situation.  This  chapter  will  arm  you  with  the  basic  knowledge to handle a windshear situation.   10.2.  Windshear definition.   10.2.1.  Windshear is any deviation in the magnitude and/or direction of adjacent winds in a  vector wind field. Severe windshear causes airspeed changes greater than 15 knots or vertical  speed changes greater than 500 feet per minute. Although windshear occurs at all altitudes, it  is  particularly  hazardous  when  it  happens  within  2,000  feet  of  the  ground  (known  as  low- level windshear, or LLWS). On approach and departure, aircraft operate only slightly above  stall speed, and a sudden change in wind velocity can lead to a loss of lift. If the loss is great  enough, and the power response inadequate, a high descent rate results. The altitude at which  the encounter occurs, the pilot reaction time, and the aircraft response capability determine if  the descent can be stopped in time to prevent an accident.   10.2.2.  The  time  factor  and  low  level  windshear  (LLWS)  can  be  illustrated  by  example.  Suppose an aircraft is straight and level at 180 KIAS flying into a 30 kt headwind. Over the  next  hour,  the  winds  change  to  a  30  knot  tailwind.  The  only  effect  on  the  aircraft  was  a  groundspeed  change  from  150  to  210  knots.  The  aircraft  effectively  accelerated  with  the  accelerating air mass without a power adjustment by the pilot. However, if the same change  occurs  over  five  to  ten  seconds,  the  air  mass  accelerates  away  from  the  aircraft,  causing  a  rapid  reduction  below  180  KIAS.  The  crew  would  have  to  react  quickly  to  accelerate  and  prevent a critical loss of airspeed. Unfortunately, not all aircraft respond fast enough to safely  fly  through  sudden  windshear  environments.  This  is  especially  true  for  jet  aircraft  with  engines  that  respond  slowly  to  changes  in  power  settings.  When  an  aircraft  enters  into  a  decreasing  headwind  over  a  short  time  period,  the  relative  velocity  of  air  over  the  wings  decreases and the indicated airspeed decreases, since lift is dependent upon relative velocity"

            "text":"of air over the wings, lift decreases with an associated increase in the vertical speed indicator  (VSI) readout. The decreasing headwind shear condition is therefore performance decreasing.   10.3.  Performance Decreasing Shear.   10.3.1.  The  hazard  associated  with  performance  decreasing  windshear  during  approaches  and takeoffs is  a significant  loss of airspeed and therefore lift. An aircraft operating at  low  speeds  and  low  altitudes  in  a  high  drag  configuration  cannot  afford  a  sudden  decrease  in  airspeed  (Figure  10.1).  When  the  shear  is  encountered,  the  aircraft  experiences  a  drop  in  airspeed and a loss in altitude. The pilot must be ready to add power when indicated airspeed  starts to decrease. Once speed and glide path are regained, thrust must be reduced to remain  at the appropriate approach speed. It will now require less thrust and a greater rate of descent  to  maintain  the  proper  profile  in  the  decreased  headwind.  If  the  initial  corrections  of  increased thrust and pitch are not promptly removed after regaining glide path and airspeed, a  long  landing  at  high  speed  may  result.  When  an  aircraft  traverses  from  a  tailwind  to  a   \f  106    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   headwind  over  a  short  time  span,  the  air\u2019s  relative  velocity  over  the  wings  increases,  the  aircraft\u2019s  inertia  causes  an  increase  in  lift,  with  an  initial  increase  in  airspeed  and  reduced  VSI indications. This  windshear condition  is  performance increasing.  Long landings  are an  obvious hazard of performance increasing windshear. However, a more critical hazard exists.  When  an  aircraft  on  approach  experiences  wind  shear  at  approach  speeds,  the  aircraft  will  experience  a  sudden  increase  in  airspeed  and  a  reduction  in  the  descent  rate.  The  pilot\u2019s  normal reaction will be to reduce power and lower pitch to compensate. Moments later, after  the  aircraft\u2019s  inertia  dissipates,  the  indicated  airspeed  (IAS)  will  drop  resulting  in  a  loss  of  lift. The aircraft will now be below approach speed at a higher descent rate and most likely  descending through the glide-path--all at a reduced power setting. If this type of shear occurs  close to the ground, the tendency is for the aircraft to land short of the runway. Therefore, it  is critical for the pilot to understand what is happening to the aircraft in order to successfully  transit the shear. Corrections to pitch and power must be positive and aggressive. But avoid  going to idle where engine spool up time could be excessive.   Figure 10.1.  Performance Decreasing Shear.   10.4.  Microburst.   10.4.1.  A  microburst  is  a  short  lived,  powerful  downdraft  associated  with  convective  activity. Observations show that approximately  five percent  of all thunderstorms produce  a  microburst.  Downdrafts  associated  with  a  microburst  are  typically  only  a  few  hundred  to  3,000  feet  across.  When  a  microburst  contacts  the  ground,  it  fans  out  in  a  radial  pattern  typically producing headwind to tailwind speed differences greater than 50 kts. The outflow  region is typically 6,000 to 12,000 feet across.   10.4.2.  Microbursts are extremely dangerous because their small size and rapidly changing  wind pattern over short distances results in extreme windshear. Characteristically, microburst  winds intensify for about 5 minutes after ground contact and typically dissipate after about 10     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     107    to 20 minutes. Since the phenomenon is short lived, this makes the \u2015If he made it, so can I\u2016  theory, or PIREPs, invalid.   10.4.3.  When penetrating a microburst, an aircraft experiences a headwind followed rapidly  by a strong downdraft and then a tailwind. This results in a dramatic loss of airspeed and a  large decrease in angle of attack. This all adds up to very high sink rate. If the shear is large  enough  and  the  altitude  low,  inadvertent  ground  contact  may  occur  regardless  of  pilot  actions. Several major aircraft accidents have been attributed to microburst windshear. One  type  of  microburst  (wet)  typically  occurs  in  conjunction  with  thunderstorms  and  is  often  embedded  in  heavy  precipitation.  Another  type  (dry)  frequently  develops  under  benign- appearing  clouds  or  virga.    Both  types  produce  extremely  dangerous  shears  occurring  with  little or no warning. Most military airfields are not equipped with sensors to detect the onset  of microburst windshear; therefore, timely PIREPs to tower or air traffic control agencies are  essential.  Due  to  rapidly  changing  conditions  typical  of  microbursts,  a  PIREP  from  the  aircraft  directly  ahead  may  not  accurately  describe  the  severity  of  windshear  you  may  encounter.   10.5.  Low Level Windshear (LLWS).   low   level  windshear.  These   10.5.1.  Several  weather  phenomena  produce  include  thunderstorms, microbursts, fronts,  land/sea breezes, low level  jets at  the top  of a radiation  inversion,  topographic  conditions,  and  mountain  waves.  Thunderstorms  are  responsible  for  two  out  of  every  three  windshear  events.  Thunderstorms  are  also  often  responsible  for  the  most  hazardous  form  of  windshear,  the  microburst.  Frontal  thunderstorms  are  usually  associated  with  weather  systems  like  fronts,  converging  winds,  and  troughs  aloft.  The  thunderstorm\u2019s  downdraft  is  fairly  large,  about  one  to  five  miles  in  diameter.  Resultant  outflows  may  produce  large  changes  in  wind  speed.  Downdrafts  exiting  the  base  of  a  thunderstorm  spread outward upon reaching the surface and form  an area of gustiness  near  the  thunderstorm.  The  gust-front  is  the  outer  limit  of  this  gusty  area.  The  gust-front  frequently  extends  10  to  20  miles  from  the  thunderstorm.  Across  the  gust  front,  vertical  shears of 10 kts per 100 feet of altitude and horizontal shears of 40 kts per mile have been  recorded.  In  addition  to  the  tremendous  speed  shears  reached,  most  severe  thunderstorms  produce directional shears of 90o to 180o. The thunderstorm downdraft may produce the most  dangerous shear conditions  associated  with  the outflow of a thunderstorm.  For  example, in  Figure  10.2,  an  aircraft  passing  through  the  gust  front  and  downdraft  would  encounter  not  only  a rapid  change in  the horizontal wind field  but  also  a downward vertical  motion.  The  downward vertical motion can add or subtract 2,000 feet per minute or more to the descent or  ascent  rate  of  the  aircraft.  The  resulting  loss  of  lift  could  prove  disastrous  to  the  aircrew.  Windshear associated with thunderstorms is by far the most hazardous due to the complexity  and  multiplicity  of  the  shears  produced.  Prevailing  low  level  winds  are  forced  up  over  the  gust front; currents feeding into the storm are present, and more than one gust front may be  encountered due to multiple downdrafts. In addition, extreme downdrafts may occur beneath  the central regions of the storm. Avoid approaches or departures in an environment of rapidly  changing wind directions and speed since this can be disastrous (Figure 10.3).   \f  108    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 10.2.  Windshear Associated with Thunderstorm Downdraft.   Figure 10.3.  Approach and Takeoff can be Dangerous in Rapidly Changing Shear  Conditions.   10.6.  Frontal Shear.   10.6.1.  Winds  can be significantly different  in  the two air masses meeting to  form  a front.  Fronts most conducive to significant windshear are fast moving (30 kts or more) or have at       \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     109    least a 5oC (9oF) temperature differential. Low level windshear occurs with a cold front after  the front passes the aerodrome. Because cold fronts have a greater slope and normally move  faster than warm fronts, the duration of low level windshear at a station is usually less than 2  hours. Windshear associated with a warm front is more dangerous to aerodrome operations.  Strong  winds  aloft,  associated  with  the  warm  front  may  cause  a  rapid  change  in  wind  direction  and  speed  where  warm  air  overrides  the  cold,  dense  air  near  the  surface.  Warm  frontal windshear may persist 6 hours or more over an airfield ahead of the front because of  the front\u2019s shallow slope and slow movement.   10.7.  Local Winds.   10.7.1.  The  low  level  jet  often  forms  just  above  a  radiation  inversion.  It  starts  to  form  at  sundown,  reaches  maximum  intensity  just  before  sunrise,  and  is  destroyed  by  daytime  heating  (usually by 10  AM local  time). The low level  jet can occur  anywhere in  the world  during the entire year. In the United States it\u2019s common in the Great Plains and central states.  As the Earth cools, it creates a calm, stable dome of cold air 300-1,000 feet thick, called an  inversion layer (see Chapter 9). The low level jet occurs just above the top of the inversion  layer,  and  while  speeds  of  30  kts  are  common,  wind  speeds  in  excess  of  60  kts  have  been  reported.  Anytime a  radiation inversion  is  present,  low level  windshear is possible (Figure  10.4).   Figure 10.4.  Windshear During Radiation Inversion.   10.7.2.  Some  aerodromes  are  notorious  for  their  frequent  treacherous  winds.  These  winds  are  caused  by  funneling,  i.e.,  the  terrain  forces  the  prevailing  winds  to  channel  through  a  narrow space (such as  a canyon) where it  accelerates and spills  out  into an aircraft\u2019s flight  path.  These  winds  can  sometimes  reach  80  kts  or  more.  Use  caution  when  conducting  operations near mountains or along straits and channels (Figure 10.5).     \f  110    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 10.5.  A Wind Funneling Condition.   10.7.3.  Mountain  waves  (see  Chapter  9)  often  create  low  level  windshear  at  aerodromes  lying  downwind  of  the  wave.  While  not  a  prerequisite,  altocumulus  standing  lenticular  (ACSL) clouds usually indicate the presence of mountain waves, and are clues to anticipate  strong shears.   10.8.  Land/Sea Breeze Shear.   10.8.1.  Two less prominent sources of low level windshear deserve a brief discussion: gusty  or strong surface winds and land/sea breezes. Fluctuations of 10 kts or more from the mean  sustained  wind  speed  or  strong  winds  blowing  past  buildings  and  structures  near  a  runway  can  produce  localized  shear.  This  type  of  shear  is  particularly  hazardous  to  light  aircraft.  Observing the local terrain and requesting PIREPs of conditions near the runway are the best  means for anticipating windshear from this source.   10.8.2.  Land  and  sea  breezes  are  a  common  occurrence  near  large  bodies  of  water  (see  Chapter 5). Differential heating and cooling of land and water causes this air flow. There is a  windshear  boundary  present  between  the  lower  land/sea  breeze  with  the  prevailing  upper  level winds present just above the land/sea breeze boundary. If the upper and lower winds are  from  the  same  direction,  windshear  is  not  much  of  a  problem;  but  if  the  winds  are  from  opposite  directions,  windshear  can  be  as  high  as  40  knots!  The  sea  breeze  is  primarily  a  daytime phenomenon. It\u2019s a small scale frontal boundary with prevailing wind speeds of 15  to  20  kts,  and  moves  inland  10  to  20  miles.  The  depth  of  the  sea  breeze  is  approximately  2,000 feet,  land breezes  occur at  night  when the land becomes  cooler than the water.  Land  breezes are not as strong as sea breezes and are little threat to flying safety.   10.9.  Windshear Lessons Learned.     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     111    10.9.1.  Analysis  of  past  windshear  accidents  and  incidents  has  taught  valuable  lessons  regarding  windshear  recognition  and  flight  path  control.  Engineering  studies  and  flight  simulator  evaluations  have  been  conducted  to  gather  additional  information.  The  primary  lesson  learned  is  that  the  best  defense  against  windshear  is  to  avoid  it  altogether.  This  is  important  because  windshear  can  exist  which  is  beyond  the  capability  of  any  pilot  or  airplane. In most windshear accidents, several clues--Low Level Wind Shear Alerts, weather  reports, visual signs--were present that would have alerted the aircrew.   10.9.2.  Recognition  of  windshear  is  difficult  and  is  usually  accompanied  by  marginal  weather. The time available for recognition and recovery is short, in some instances as little  as  5  seconds.  Flight  crew  coordination  is  essential  for  prompt  windshear  recognition  and  recovery. Pilots can control flight path with pitch attitude. Lower than normal airspeed may  have  to  be  accepted  to  counter  loss  of  lift.  Three  main  windshear  situations  and  suggested  pilot techniques are presented below.   10.9.3.  In  a  typical  accident  studied,  the  airplane  encountered  an  increasing  tailwind  shear  shortly after lifting off the runway. For the first 5 seconds after liftoff, the takeoff appeared  normal, but the aircraft crashed off the end of the runway about 20 seconds after liftoff.   10.9.4.  In  many  events,  early  trends  in  airspeed,  pitch  attitude,  vertical  speed  and  altitude  appeared normal. In this example, the aircraft encountered windshear before stabilized climb  was  established  which  caused  difficulty  in  detecting  onset  of  shear.  As  the  airspeed  was  decreased, pitch attitude was reduced to regain airspeed. By reducing pitch attitude, available  performance  capability  was  not  utilized  and  the  airplane  lost  altitude.  As  terrain  became  a  factor, recovery to initial pitch attitude was initiated. This required unusually high stick force.  Corrective action was too late to prevent ground contact since the downward flight path was  well established.   10.9.5.  Reducing  pitch  attitude  to  regain  lost  airspeed,  or  allowing  attitude  to  decrease  in  response  to  lost  airspeed,  is  the  result  of  past  training  emphasis  on  airspeed  control.  Successful  recovery  from  an  inadvertent  windshear  encounter  requires  maintaining  or  increasing  pitch  attitude  and  accepting  lower  than  usual  airspeed.  Unusual  and  unexpected  control inputs may be required to counter natural airplane pitching tendencies due to airspeed  and  lift  loss.  To  counter  the  loss  of  airspeed  and  angle  of  attack,  pitch  attitude  must  be  increased  above  the  normal  range.  Only  by  properly  controlling  angle  of  attack  (AOA)  through  pitch  attitude  and  accepting  a  reduced  airspeed  can  flight  path  degradation  be  prevented. Once the airplane begins to deviate from the intended flight path and high descent  rates develop, it takes additional time and altitude to change flight path direction.   10.9.6.  In  the  windshear  scenario  just  described,  available  aircraft  performance  capability  may not have been used because of two factors: lack of timely recognition and inappropriate  or inadequate response. Rapidly deteriorating climb performance may not be apparent to the  crew unless all appropriate vertical flight path instruments are closely monitored. Only 5 to  10  seconds  may  be  available  to  recognize  and  respond  to  the  shear.  It\u2019s  imperative  that  a  windshear  encounter  be  recognized  as  soon  as  possible.  Timely  windshear  recognition  requires effective crew coordination.   10.9.7.  Analysis  of  a  typical  accident  where  an  increasing  tailwind  shear  was  encountered  during takeoff ground roll showed that initial indications appeared normal. Due to increasing  tailwind  shear,  the  airplane  didn\u2019t  reach  rotational  speed  (Vr)  until  nearing  the  end  of  the   \f  112    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   runway.  As  the  aircraft  lifted  off,  the  tailwind  continued  increasing,  preventing  any  further  airspeed increase. The airplane encountered an obstacle off the departure end of the runway.  An  additional  factor  is  the  difficulty  of  recognizing  deteriorating  aircraft  performance.  Timely recognition of a windshear encounter on the runway may be difficult since the only  indication  may  be  slower  than  normal  acceleration.  The  presence  of  gusts  may  mask  abnormal airspeed build-up. Full thrust may be required to provide additional performance,  particularly  if  reduced  thrust  takeoff  procedures  have  been  used.  If  there  is  insufficient  runway left to accelerate to normal takeoff speed, and inadequate runway to stop, liftoff and  safe climb may require rotation at speeds less than normal Vr. In this case, additional pitch  attitude  may  be  required  to  achieve  sufficient  lift.  Rotation  to  higher  than  normal  pitch  attitude at lower than normal airspeed may be required to lift off the remaining runway which  may  result  in  aft  body  contact.  To  deal  with  an  inadvertent  windshear  encounter,  the  pilot  must be prepared to apply techniques which differ from those ordinarily used.   10.9.8.  Analysis  of  typical  windshear  encounters  on  approach  yields  that  the  aircrew  can  expect  increased  downdrafts  and  tailwinds  along  the  approach  flight  path.  The  aircraft  will  lose airspeed, drop below the target glideslope, and contact the ground short of the runway  threshold.  Reduced  airspeed  and  AOA,  as  the  aircraft  encounters  the  windshear,  results  in  decreased  lift.  This  loss  of  lift  increases  the  descent  rate.  The  natural  nose-down  pitch  response of the aircraft to low airspeed causes additional altitude loss.   10.9.9.  Lack  of  clues  and  limited  recognition  time  will  delay  recovery  initiation.  Gradual  application  of  thrust  during  approach  may  mask  the  initial  decreasing  airspeed  trend.  Poor  weather conditions  will  cause  additional workload and  complicate the approach.  Transition  from instruments to exterior visual reference may detract from instrument scan. A stabilized  approach with clearly defined callouts is essential to aid in recognition of unacceptable flight  path trends and the need to initiate recovery.   10.9.10.  As soon as you recognize that you have flown into a microburst, you must push the  power all the way up. You will be in  for a scary ride and will need all the energy  you can  muster. Do not change your configuration. You are about to fly right on the verge of a stall  and any configuration change may put you over the edge.   10.9.11.  After that, it will be all finesse with the controls. Pull the nose up until you get the  stall  warning  or  reach  maximum  performance  AOA  and  hold  it  there.  Fly  off  the  AOA  or  stall warning system. You must compensate for the relative wind change that will occur from  the downdraft, and AOA is the only thing that matters at this point. The whole maneuver will  result  in  an  extremely  nose  high  attitude.  This  will  feel  completely  wrong,  but  it  is  critical  that you maintain maximum performance AOA so that the wings can produce lift and slow  your descent rate. Once you get to the other side of the microburst, you will need to lower the  nose to maintain your AOA as the winds start spreading along the ground again. Eventually  you  should  return  to  level  flight  and  can  get  back  your  pre-microburst  configuration  and  resume level flight and normal airspeed.   10.9.12.  The  vertical  speed  indicator  (VSI)  should  not  be  solely  relied  upon  to  provide  accurate  vertical  speed  information.  Due  to  instrument  lags,  indications  may  be  several  seconds behind  actual aircraft rate of climb/descent and, in some situations, may indicate a  climb after the aircraft has started descending. Vertical speed indicators driven by an Inertial  Reference  Unit  (IRU)  show  significant  improvement  over  other  type  instruments  but  still   \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     113    have some lag. In addition, gust-induced pitot static pressure variations within the microburst  may introduce further VSI inaccuracies. Due to such lags and errors, all vertical flight path  instruments should be cross-checked to verify climb/descent trends.   10.10.  Stick Shaker.   10.10.1.  Stick shaker is activated by angle of attack. Consequently, rapidly changing vertical  winds or maneuvering will vary the attitude and airspeed at which stick shaker occurs. With a  properly  functioning  stall  warning  system  and  undamaged  alpha  vanes,  stick  shaker  will  normally activate below the stall angle of attack, thus providing a warning prior to stall.   10.10.2.  Angle  of  attack  indicators  do  provide  useful  indications  of  margin  to  stick  shaker  and can show variations in relative wind. However, in an actual windshear encounter where  rapidly changing vertical winds cause rapid angle of attack fluctuations independent of pilot  input,  the  lack  of  direct  control  over  angle  of  attack  limits  its  usefulness  as  a  guiding  parameter.   10.10.3.  During  callouts  and  instrument  scan  in  a  windshear,  use  of  barometric  altimeters  must  be  tempered.  The  barometric  altimeter  may  provide  distorted  indications  due  to  pressure variations within the microburst.   10.11.  Windshear Detection Systems.   10.11.1.  Many civilian airfields have, or are installing windshear detection systems such as  Low  Level  Windshear  Alert  Systems  (LLWAS)  and  Terminal  Doppler  Weather  Radars  (TDWR). Currently there is no instrumentation on Air Force runways to detect and measure  windshear,  and  there  are  no  foolproof  procedures  for  dealing  with  it.  Awareness  and  coordination are crucial for timely windshear recognition and recovery.   10.11.2.  A SIGMET, particularly  a CONVECTIVE SIGMET, may provide essential clues.  In  the  following  example,  the  CONVECTIVE  SIGMET  warns  of  scattered  embedded  thunderstorms,  some  reaching  level  5  intensity,  indicating  a  potential  for  windshear.

Reports  of  sudden  airspeed  changes  in  the  airport  approach  or  landing  corridors  provide  indication  of  the  presence  of  windshear.  In  international  weather  reports,  windshear  observations  may  be  included  at  the  end  of  routine  and/or  special  aviation  weather  observations.

Introduction.  Aircraft  icing  is  a  major  weather  hazard  to  aviation.  Many  aircraft  accidents and incidents have been attributed to aircraft icing. In fact, many icing-related mishaps  have occurred when the aircraft was not deiced before takeoff. Most of the time, ground deicing  and anti-icing procedures will adequately handle icing formation, but there are times when you  may  be  caught  unaware  of  dangerous  ice  buildup.  This  chapter  will  help  you  understand  icing  formation processes and what you can do if suddenly caught in an icing situation.   11.1.1.  Icing formation  on either fixed or  rotary wing  aircraft disrupts the flow of air over  the airfoils increasing weight and stalling speed. Test data indicates that icing reduces wing  lift by up to 30 percent and increases drag by 40 percent. The accumulation of ice on exterior  movable surfaces also affects the control of the aircraft. If ice begins forming on a propeller\u2019s  blades,  the  propeller\u2019s  efficiency  decreases  and  requires  further  power  to  maintain  flight.  Another significant hazard comes from ice accumulation on rotors and propellers resulting in  disastrous  vibrations.  Ice  can  also  form  in  an  engine\u2019s  intake,  robbing  the  engine  of  air  needed  to  support  combustion,  or  ice  may  break  off  and  may  be  ingested  into  the  engine,  causing foreign object damage (FOD). Other icing effects include loss of proper operation of  control surfaces, brakes, or landing gear; reduction or loss of aircrew\u2019s outside vision, false  flight instrument indications, and loss of radio communication.   11.2.  Groups of Icing.   11.2.1.  Aircraft  icing  is  classified  into  two  main  groups:  structural  and  induction.  We  will  discuss these icing groups in detail to include conditions contributing to ice formation, icing  intensities, icing types, and where icing is most likely found.   11.3.  Structural Icing.   11.3.1.  Two conditions must be met for structural ice to form on an aircraft. First, the air and  aircraft\u2019s  surface  temperatures  must  be  at  or  below  freezing.  (Instances  of  freezing  precipitation are exempt from this rule.) Second, supercooled, visible water droplets (liquid  water droplets at subfreezing temperatures) must be present or high humidity must exist.   11.3.2.  Wind  tunnel  experiments  reveal  that  saturated  air  flowing  over  a  stationary  object  may  form  ice  on  the  object  when  the  air  temperature  is  as  high  as  4oC.  The  object\u2019s  temperature  cools  by  evaporation  and  pressure  changes  in  the  moving  air  currents.  Conversely,  friction  and  water  droplet  impacts  heat  the  object.  When  an  aircraft  travels  at  about  400  kts  true  airspeed,  the  cooling  and  heating  effects  tend  to  balance.  Structural  ice  may form when the free-air temperature is 0oC or colder. Icing is seldom encountered below  -40oC.   11.3.3.  Clouds are the most common forms of visible liquid water. Water droplets in the free  air, unlike bulk water, do not freeze at 0oC. Instead, their freezing temperature varies from - 10 to -40oC. The smaller the droplets, the lower the freezing point. As a general rule, serious  icing  is  rare  in  clouds  with  temperatures  below  -20oC  since  these  clouds  are  almost  completely composed of ice crystals. However, be aware that icing is possible in any cloud   \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     115    when  the  temperature  is  0oC  or  below.  In  addition,  frost  may  form  on  an  aircraft  in  clear,  humid air if the aircraft skin temperature is below freezing.   11.3.4.  Freezing rain and drizzle, sometimes found in the clear air below a cloud deck, are  other  forms  of  visible  liquid  moisture  causing  icing.  Freezing  precipitation  is  the  most  dangerous of all icing conditions. It can build hazardous amounts of ice in a few minutes and  is extremely difficult to remove. A review of freezing rain and drizzle environments is found  in Chapter 8, Fronts.   11.4.  Types of Icing.   11.4.1.  Aircraft structural icing consists of three basic types: clear, rime and mixed. Frost is  another  form  of  icing,  but  is  not  forecasted  as  a  type  of  icing.  Icing  types  that  form  will  depend primarily upon the water droplet size and temperature.   11.4.1.1.  Clear ice is a glossy ice identical to the glaze forming on trees and other objects  as freezing rain strikes the Earth. Clear ice is the most serious of the various forms of ice  because  it  adheres  so  firmly  to  the  aircraft.  Conditions  most  favorable  for  clear  ice  formation  are  high  water  content,  large  droplet  size,  and  temperatures  slightly  below  freezing. Clear ice normally forms when temperatures are between 0o and -16oC, and is  most  frequently  forecasted  in  cumuliform  clouds  between  0o  and  -08  oC  and  during  freezing  precipitation.  Clear  icing  can  also  be  encountered  in  cumulonimbus  clouds  in  temperatures as low as -25oC. It   11.4.1.2.  Clear  ice  can  be  smooth  or  rough.  It  is  smooth  when  deposited  from  large,  supercooled cloud droplets or raindrops that spread, adhere to the surface of the aircraft  and slowly freeze. If mixed with snow, ice pellets or small hail, it is rough, irregular, and  whitish  (Figure  11.1).  The  deposit  then  becomes  very  blunt-nosed  with  rough  bulges  building out against the airflow. Clear ice is hard, heavy, and tenacious.  Its  removal by  deicing equipment is especially difficult.   \f  116    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 11.1.  Clear Ice can be Smooth or Rough.   11.4.1.3.  Rime ice is a milky, opaque, and granular deposit with a rough surface (Figure  11.2). It forms by the instantaneous freezing of small, supercooled water droplets as they  strike the aircraft. This instantaneous freezing traps a large amount of air, giving the ice  its  opaqueness  and  making  it  very  brittle.  Rime  ice  is  most  frequently  encountered  in  stratiform  clouds  but  also  occurs  in  cumulus  clouds.  Rime  ice  may  form  in  stratiform  clouds from  0o  to  -30oC, but  most frequently occurs  within stratus  clouds between  -08o  and -10oC.It may also accumulate when temperatures in cumuliform clouds are between  0o and -20oC but can be expected in thunderstorms as cold as -40oC. Rime ice is lighter in  weight than clear ice and its weight is of little significance. Rime ice is brittle and more"

            "text":"easily removed than clear ice.     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     117    Figure 11.2.  Rime Ice is Milky, Opaque, and Granular.   11.4.1.4.  Mixed  icing  forms  when  water  drops  vary  in  size  or  when  liquid  drops  are  intermingled  with  snow  or  ice  particles.  It  can  form  rapidly.  Ice  particles  become  embedded  in  clear  ice,  building  a  very  rough  accumulation  sometimes  in  a  mushroom  shape on leading edges. Mixed icing is generally forecasted at temperatures between -9o  and -15oC, and is commonly encountered between -10o and -15oC.   11.4.1.5.  Frost is deposited as a thin layer of crystalline ice (Figure 11.3). It forms on the  exposed surfaces of parked aircraft when the temperature of the exposed surface is below  freezing (although the air temperature may be above freezing). The deposit forms during  night  radiational  cooling  in  the  same  way  the  formation  of  frost  found  on  the  ground.  Frost  may  also  form  on  aircraft  in  flight  when  a  cold  aircraft  moves  from  a  zone  of  subzero  temperatures  to  a  warmer,  moist  layer.  Contact  with  the  cold  aircraft  suddenly  chills  the  air  to  below  freezing  temperatures  and  deposition  (formation  of  ice  crystals  directly  from  water  vapor)  occurs.  Frost  can  cover  the  windshield  or  canopy  and  completely restrict outside vision. It also affects the aircraft\u2019s lift to drag ratio and can be  a hazard during takeoff. Remove all frost from the aircraft prior to departure.     \f  118    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 11.3.  Frost on Exposed Surfaces of Parked Aircraft.   11.5.  Icing Amounts.   11.5.1.  The  amount  of  the  characteristics  of  that  particular  aircraft.  Therefore,  general  intensity  classifications  for  reporting  icing  are  given  in  the  \u2015Meteorological  Information\u2016  section  of  the  Flight  Information Handbook (FIH) and are described below.   ice  an  aircraft  accumulates  depends  considerably  on   11.5.1.1.  Trace--Ice  becomes  perceptible.  The  rate  of  accumulation  is  slightly  greater  than rate of sublimation. It is not hazardous unless encountered for an extended period of  time (over one hour) even though de-icing/anti-icing equipment is not used,.   11.5.1.2.  Light--The rate of accumulation may create a problem if flight is prolonged in  this  environment  (over  one  hour).  Occasional  use  of  de-icing/anti-icing  equipment  removes/prevents  accumulation.  It  does  not  present  a  problem  if  the  de-icing/anti-icing  equipment is used.   11.5.1.3.  Moderate--The rate of accumulation is such that even short encounters become  potentially hazardous and use of de-icing /anti-icing equipment or diversion is necessary.   11.5.1.4.  Severe--The  rate  of  accumulation  is  such  that  de-icing/anti-icing  equipment  fails to reduce or control the hazard. Immediate diversion is necessary.   11.6.  Icing Dangers.   11.6.1.  The relatively thick wings, canopies, and other features of conventional aircraft have  a smaller collection potential than those of the trimmer and faster turbojet aircraft. However,  the actual hazard of icing for conventional aircraft tends to be greater than for jets because of  less  aerodynamic  heating  at  lower  airspeed.  Conventional  aircraft  are  subjected  to  icing  conditions  over  longer  periods  and  operate  at  altitudes  more  conducive  to  icing.  Ice  accumulations on wing and tail surfaces disrupt the air flow around these airfoils. This results  in a loss of lift, an increase in drag, and causes higher than normal stall speeds (Figure 11.4).  The  weight  of  the  ice  deposit  presents  less  danger,  but  may  become  important  when  too  much lift and thrust are lost. Experiments have shown that a \u00bd inch ice deposit on the leading  edge of airfoils on some aircraft reduce their lift by as much as 50 percent and increases drag     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     119    on  the  aircraft  by  the  same  amount,  which  greatly  increases  the  stall  speed.  The  serious  consequences  of  these  effects  are  obvious.  Remember  that  \u00bd  inch  or  more  of  ice  can  accumulate in a minute or two.   Figure 11.4.  Effects of Icing are Cumulative Causing Stall Speed to Increase.   11.6.2.  Ice accumulation on the propeller hub and blades reduces the propeller\u2019s efficiency,  which reduces thrust.  Increased power settings consume more fuel  and may fail to produce  sufficient thrust to maintain altitude. An even greater hazard is the vibration of the propeller,  caused  by  the  uneven  distribution  of  ice  on  the  blades.  A  propeller  is  very  delicately  balanced, and even a small amount of ice creates an imbalance. The resulting vibration places  dangerous  stress  on  the  engine  mounts  as  well  as  the  propeller  itself.  Propellers  with  low  RPM are more susceptible to icing than those with high RPM. Ice usually forms faster on the  propeller\u2019s hub because the blade\u2019s differential velocity causes a temperature increase from  the hub to the propeller tip.   11.6.3.  Icing of the pitot tube (Figure 11.5) and static pressure ports is dangerous because it  causes inaccurate indications on the altimeter, airspeed, and VSI. When icing is observed on  the aircraft, remember that the pitot tubes accumulate ice as fast as or faster than other areas  of the aircraft.   11.6.4.  The  principal  danger  of  ice  accumulating  on  the  aircraft\u2019s  radio  antenna  is  the  probable  loss  of  radio  communication.  Antennas  are  usually  one  of  the  first  items  on  an  aircraft  to  collect  ice.  Other  parts  of  the  aircraft  will  also  begin  to  accumulate  ice  if  the  antennas  start  icing  up.  Ultimately,  aircrews  lose  their  ability  to  request  altitude  or  course  changes to get out of the icing zone.     \f  120    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 11.5.  Pitot Tube Icing.   11.6.5.  Ice or frost formation on an aircraft\u2019s windshield is most hazardous during takeoffs  and landings. Small frost particles on the windshield prior to takeoff may act as sublimation  nuclei during takeoff and reduce visibility to near zero. On approach, windshield icing may  prevent  visual  contact  with  the  runway.  In  large  helicopters,  windshield  icing  is  a  good  indication that main rotor head and rotor blade icing is well underway. Reciprocating engines  experience  icing  on  air  scoops,  scoop  inlets  (ducts),  carburetor  inlet  screens  and  other  induction  system  protuberances.  All  surfaces  of  the  engine  exposed  to  water  droplets  may  collect ice.   11.7.  Helicopter Icing.   11.7.1.  Icing on rotary wing aircraft is related to those involving wings and propellers. Rotor  icing is  slightly different  from  propeller icing due to  the rotors\u2019 lower rotational speed.  Ice  accumulation on rotor blades differs from the fixed wings of conventional aircraft due to the  smaller  scale  of  the  helicopter  wing,  the  variation  of  airspeed  with  rotor  blade  span,  the  cyclic pitch  change, and the cyclic variation of  airspeed  at  any  given point  on the blade in  forward flight. Ice formation on the helicopter main rotor system or anti-torque rotor system  may produce serious vibration, loss of efficiency or control, and can significantly deteriorate  the  available  RPM  to  a  level  where  safe  landing  cannot  be  assured.  Although  the  slow  forward speed of the helicopter reduces ice build-up on the fuselage, the rotational speed of  main  and  tail  rotor  blades  produces  a  rapid  growth  rate  on  certain  surface  areas.  Ice  accumulation  on  the  swash  plates,  push-pull  rods,  bell  cranks,  hinges,  scissors  assemblies,  and other mechanisms of the main rotor head assembly interferes with collective and cyclic  inputs.   11.7.2.  Several  factors  tend  to  reduce  ice  accretion  on  the  main  rotor  blades,  such  as  the  centrifugal  force  of  rotation,  blade  flexing  during  rotation,  the  slow  rotational  speed  of  the  blades  near  the  rotor  head,  and  the  fast  rotational  speed  near  the  blade  tips.  However,  in  a  hover, a 3/16 inch coating of ice is sufficient to prevent some helicopters from maintaining  flight. A critical icing hazard can, therefore, form rapidly on the center two-thirds of the main     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     121    rotor  blades.  The  uneven  accretion  or  asymmetrical  shedding  of  ice  produces  severe  rotor  vibration. Ice accumulation on either the antitorque rotor head assembly or blades produces  the  same  hazards  as  those  associated  with  the  main  rotor.  The  centrifugal  force  of  rotation  and the blade angle of incidence relative to the clouds help to reduce ice build-up on the tail  rotor blades, but the shedding of ice from the blades may result in structural damage or FOD  to  the  fuselage,  rotors  or  engines,  and  injury  to  ground  personnel.  This  particular  hazard  appears to be more threatening to large, tandem rotor aircraft.   11.7.3.  Ice accumulation on the engine and transmission air intake screens is more rapid than  on the rotor systems. This results in inadequate cooling of the engine and transmission. On  some helicopters, a loss of manifold pressure concurrently with air intake screen icing may  force  an  immediate  landing.  Freezing  water  passing  through  the  screens  also  coats  control  cables and may produce limited throttle movement and other control problems.   11.8.  Engine Icing.   11.8.1.  In addition to the hazards created by structural icing, aircraft are frequently subjected  to  engine  icing.  The  affected  components  supply  the  engine  with  the  proper  fuel  and  air  mixture  for  efficient  combustion.  Induction  icing  occurs  under  a  wide  range  of  weather  conditions and is most common in the air induction system but may also be found in the fuel  system. Carburetor icing in carburetor equipped piston engines is actually a combination of  the two.   11.9.  Carburetor Icing.   11.9.1.  Carburetor icing is treacherous. It frequently causes complete engine failure. It may  form under conditions in which structural ice could not possibly form. If the air drawn into  the  carburetor  has  a  high  relative  humidity,  ice  can  form  inside  the  carburetor  in  cloudless  skies  with  temperatures  as  high  as  22oC  (72oF).  It  sometimes  forms  with  outside  air  temperatures  as  low  as  -  10oC  (14oF).  Carburetor  ice  forms  during  fuel  vaporization,  combined with the air expanding as it passes through the carburetor. Temperature drop in the  carburetor  can  be  as  much  as  40oC  but  is  usually  20oC  or  less.  With  enough  available  moisture, ice will form in the carburetor passages (Figure 11.6) if the temperature inside the  carburetor cools down to 0oC or below. Ice may form at the discharge nozzle, in the Venturi,  on or around the butterfly valve, or in the passages from the carburetor to the engine.   \f  122    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 11.6.  Carburetor Icing.   11.9.2.  The carburetor heater is an anti-icing device which heats the air before it reaches the  carburetor, melting any ice or snow entering the intake, and keeping the mixture above the  freezing point. The heater usually prevents icing, but it cannot always clear out ice already  formed.  Since  carburetor  heating  adversely  affects  aircraft  performance,  use  it  only  as  specified  in  your  flight  manual.  The  fuel  absorbs  considerable  amounts  of  water  when  the  humidity is high. Occasionally, enough water is  absorbed to  create icing in the fuel system  when the fuel temperature is at or below 0oC.   11.10.  Induction Icing.   11.10.1.  Ice  forms  in  the  induction  system  when  atmospheric  conditions  are  favorable  for  structural icing (visible liquid moisture and freezing temperatures). Induction icing can form  in  clear  air  with  a  high  relative  humidity  (small  temperature/dew  point  spread)  and  temperatures anywhere from 22oC (72oF) to -10oC (14oF).   11.10.2.  In  flights  through  clouds  containing  supercooled  water  droplets,  air  intake  duct  icing  is  similar  to  wing  icing.  However,  duct  icing  may  occur  with  clear  skies  and  above  freezing temperatures. While taxiing, and on departure, reduced pressures exist in the intake  system  (Figure  11.7).  This  lowers  temperatures  to  the  point  where  condensation  or  sublimation  takes  place,  resulting  in  ice  formation  which  decreases  the  radius  of  the  duct  opening and limits air intake.   11.10.3.  The  temperature  change  varies  considerably  with  different  types  of  engines.  Therefore, if the air temperature is 10oC or less (especially near the freezing point) and the  relative humidity is high, the possibility of induction icing definitely exists.     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     123    Figure 11.7.  Jet Engine Induction Icing.   11.11.  Inlet Guide Vane Icing.   11.11.1.  Icing  occurs  when  supercooled  water  droplets  in  the  atmosphere  strike  the  guide  vanes and freeze. As ice build-up increases, air flow to the engine decreases, which results in  a  loss  of  thrust  and  eventual  engine  flameout.  Also,  ingestion  of  ice  shed  ahead  of  the  compressor inlet may cause severe engine damage.   11.12.  Weather Conditions for Icing.   11.12.1.  Potential  icing  zones  in  the  atmosphere  are  mainly  a  function  of  temperature  and  cloud  structure.  These  factors  vary  with  altitude,  location,  weather  pattern,  season,  and  terrain.  11.12.2.  Generally, aircraft icing is limited to the atmospheric layer lying between 0oC and - 20o C. However, icing has been reported at temperatures colder than -40oC in the upper parts  of cumulonimbus and other clouds. The types of icing in cumuliform clouds are associated  with the following temperature ranges:   Table 11.1.  Temperature Ranges.   11.12.3.  Icing  in  middle  and  low  level  stratiform  clouds  is  confined,  on  the  average,  to  a  layer  between  3,000  and  4,000  feet  thick.  Icing  intensity  generally  ranges  from  a  trace  to  light, with the maximum values occurring in the cloud\u2019s upper portions. Both rime and mixed  are  found  in  stratiform  clouds.  The  main  hazard  lies  in  the  great  horizontal  extent  of  these  cloud decks. High-level stratiform clouds are composed mostly of ice crystals and give little       \f  124    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   icing. The icing zone in cumuliform clouds is smaller horizontally but greater vertically than  in stratiform clouds. Icing is more variable in cumuliform clouds because many of the factors  conducive  to  icing  depend  on  the  particular  cloud\u2019s  stage  of  development.  Icing  intensities  may  range  from  a  trace  in  a  small  cumulus  to  severe  in  a  large  towering  cumulus  or  cumulonimbus.  Although  icing  occurs  at  all  levels  above  the  freezing  level  in  a  building  cumulus,  it  is  most  intense  in  the  upper  half  of  the  cloud.  Icing  in  a  cumuliform  cloud  is  usually  clear  or  mixed  with  rime  in  the  upper  levels.  Aircraft  icing  rarely  occurs  in  cirrus  clouds although some do contain a small portion of water droplets. However, light icing has  been  reported  in  the  dense,  cirrus  anvils  of  cumulonimbus,  where  updrafts  maintain  considerable amounts of water at rather low temperatures.   11.12.4.  Of all icing conditions reported, 85 percent occur in the vicinity of fronts. This icing  may be in relatively warm air above the frontal surface or in the cold air beneath  (Figures  11.8 and 11.9). For significant icing to occur above the frontal surface, the warm air must be  lifted and cooled to saturation at temperatures below freezing, making it contain supercooled  water.  If  the  warm  air  is  unstable,  icing  may  be  sporadic;  if  it  is  stable,  icing  may  be  continuous  over  an  extended  area.  Icing  may  form  in  this  manner  over  either  a  warm  or  a  shallow cold frontal surface. A line of showers or thunderstorms along a surface cold front  may produce icing, but only in a comparatively narrow band along the front (Figure 11.10).  Icing below a frontal surface outside of clouds occurs most often in freezing rain or drizzle.  Precipitation forms in the relatively warm air above the frontal surface at temperatures above  freezing.  It  falls  into  the  subfreezing  air  below  the  front,  supercools  and  freezes  on  impact  with  the  aircraft.  Freezing  drizzle  and  rain  occur  with  both  warm  and  shallow  cold  fronts.  Icing in freezing precipitation is especially hazardous since it often extends horizontally over  a broad area and downward to the surface.   Figure 11.8.  Cold Front Icing.     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     125    Figure 11.9.  Warm Front Icing.   Figure 11.10.  Primary Icing Regions.   11.12.5.  Icing may occur during any season of the year, but in temperate climates, such as in  most  of  the  United  States,  it  is  most  frequent  in  winter.  The  freezing  level  is  nearer  to  the  ground in winter than in summer, leaving a smaller low level layer of airspace free of icing  conditions.  Frontal  activity  is  also  more  frequent  in  winter  and  the  resulting  cloud  systems  more extensive. Regions at higher latitudes, such as Canada and Alaska, generally have the  most severe icing conditions in spring and fall. In winter, the polar regions are normally too  cold to contain heavy concentrations of moisture necessary for icing, and most cloud systems  are  stratiform  and  composed  of  ice  crystals.  Icing  is  more  likely  and  more  severe  in  mountainous regions than over other terrain. Mountain ranges cause upward air motions on  their windward side. These vertical currents support large water droplets normally falling as  rain over level terrain. The movement of a frontal system across a mountain range combines  the normal frontal lift with the mountains upslope effect to create extremely hazardous icing       \f  126    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   zones. The most severe icing occurs above the crests and on the ridges\u2019 windward side. This  zone usually extends to about 5,000 feet above the mountain tops but can extend much higher  if cumuliform clouds develop.   11.12.6.  Aircrew Notes.   11.12.6.1.  Always be prepared to  avoid  or  escape icing. The following  procedures will  help reduce icing effects on your aircraft:   11.12.6.2.  Remove all ice and snow from the aircraft before takeoff.   11.12.6.3.  Use anti-ice and de-ice equipment.   11.12.6.4.  Avoid clouds when the temperature is between 0oC and -20oC.   11.12.6.5.  If icing is encountered, climb or descend to an altitude where the temperature  is warmer than 0oC or colder than -20oC.   11.12.6.6.  Give PIREPs when encountering icing or if it is forecast and not encountered.   \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     127    Chapter 12   VISIBILITY AND CEILINGS   12.1.  Introduction.  Historically,  low  ceilings  and  poor  visibilities  have  contributed  to  many  aircraft  accidents.  Fog,  heavy  snow,  heavy  rain,  blowing  sand,  and  blowing  dust  all  restrict  visibility and can contribute to low ceilings. Adverse weather conditions causing widespread low  ceilings and visibilities can restrict flying operations for days. Since ceiling and visibility is so  important to operational flying, it\u2019s imperative that a pilot understand the strict meanings of the  two terms. There are many different kinds of \u2015visibility\u2016: slant, sector, and prevailing visibility.  You also need to know how a ceiling is determined and what constitutes a \u2015scattered\u2016 versus a  \u2015broken\u2016  deck  of  clouds.  This  chapter  explains  the  concepts  of  ceiling  and  visibility  and  their  impacts upon operational flying.   12.1.1.  Visibility is the horizontal distance determined by human or instrument evaluations  measuring  the  opacity  or  translucence  of  the  atmosphere.  By  day,  manual  visibility  is  the  greatest distance selected objects are seen and identified by unaided eyes. At night, manual  visibility is the greatest distance at which unfocused lights of moderate intensity (about 2.5  candlepower) can be seen and identified.   12.2.  Prevailing Visibility.   12.2.1.  Prevailing visibility is the greatest horizontal visibility observed throughout  at least  half  of  the  horizon  circle  and  is  considered  representative  of  conditions  6  feet  above  the  ground  at  the  observation  point.  It  need  not  be  continuous  throughout  180  consecutive  degrees.  Prevailing  visibility  determines  whether  flights  are  conducted  under  VFR  or  IFR.  Also,  circling  approaches  must  use  prevailing  visibility.  Prevailing  visibility  is  the  only  forecast visibility value and is observed and reported by the supporting weather organization.  Figure 12.1 is an example of a visibility check point diagram used by weather technicians to  evaluate  prevailing  visibility  manually  or  when  backing  up  the  automated  observation.  Air  Traffic  Controllers  have  a  similar  visibility  check  point  diagram  in  the  tower.  At  times  the  prevailing visibility from the tower vantage point may differ significantly from the weather  observer\u2019s  manual,  surface-based  visibility.  To  alert  aviators  to  this  condition,  the  tower  controller determines the tower prevailing visibility.   12.2.2.  Countries other than the US and Canada, and US overseas bases, may use different  criteria  in  determining  prevailing  visibility.  Some  countries  use  the  worst  sector  visibility  value  as  the  prevailing  visibility  value.  If  this  is  the  practice  of  the  host  country  and  their  weather  observations  are  the  official  airfield  observations,  you  must  operate  under  their  criteria.  If  US  military  observers  are  transmitting  official  observations  at  that  airfield,  then  the US visibility definitions are used. In addition to different reporting criteria, different units  of  measure  may  also  be  used.  Overseas  observations  report  visibility  in  meters  while  stateside reports use statute miles. In either case, if the visibility falls halfway between two  reportable values, the value is rounded down for flight safety reasons.   \f  128    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 12.1.  Observer Visibility Diagram.   12.3.  Automated Meteorological Observing Systems (AMOS).   12.3.1.  An AMOS refers to any certified Air Force owned and Air Force or Army accredited  observing  system  (i.e.,  AN/FMQ-19,  AN/TMQ-53,  Automated  Surface  Observing  System  (ASOS)  with  the  capability  to  automatically  collect  and  disseminate  observations,  or  other  AFWA/MAJCOM-certified automated systems) that has reached initial operating capability.  In  an  automated  observation,  the  visibility  algorithm  calculates  average  visibility  using  spatial time averaging of sensor data.  Visibility will be an evaluation of sensor data gathered  during  the  10-minute  period  ending  at  the  actual  time  of  the  observation.  The  sensor  is  usually  located  near  the  touchdown  zone  of  the  primary  designated  runway.    Figure  12.2  displays a typical automated observing site layout.     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     129    Figure 12.2.  Typical AMOS Combined Sensor Group.   12.4.  Visibilities Definitions.   12.4.1.  Sector visibility is the visibility within a specified 45 degree arc (NE, SE, SW, NW,  etc.)  of  the  horizon  circle  having  essentially  uniform  visibility.  Sector  visibility  may  be  reported when manually-derived visibility is not uniform in all horizontal directions. Sector  visibility is not reported at automated stations.   12.4.2.  Slant range visibility is the angle from which you view an airfield or target from an  \u2015above ground\u2016 vantage point. Slant range visibility is often lower than the surface prevailing  visibility. Weather technicians observe visibility  horizontally, while airborne aircrews view  the ground from their aircraft at an angle. Slant range visibility is not reported by a weather  observer.  See Figure 12.3 for examples of flight visibility and slant range visibility.     \f  130    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 12.3.  Slant Range Visibility: Distance Seen through an Angle of the Atmosphere.   12.4.3.  Runway Visual Range (RVR) is an instrumentally derived value that represents the  horizontal  distance  that  a  pilot  can  see  down  the  runway.  The  maximum  distance  in  the  direction of takeoff or landing at which the runway, or specified lights or markers delineating  it,  can  be  seen  from  a  position  above  a  specified  point  on  its  center  line  at  a  height  corresponding  to  the  average  eye  level  of  pilots  at  touch-down.    RVR  is  reported  in  either  feet or meters as determined by country or FLIP RVR minimums.   12.5.  Visibility Differences.   12.5.1.  Aircrews should keep in mind that the prevailing visibility, slant range visibility, and  RVR  will  differ  from  each  other  on  many  occasions.  At  airfields  equipped  with  AMOSs,  visibility and RVR are measured by the same sensor but determined by separate algorithms.  At  manual  observing  stations  the  weather  observer\u2019s  ability  to  take  representative  observations  is  restricted  at  some  airfields  because  one  or  both  ends  of  the  runway  are  not  visible from the observing site or buildings or other obstructions may restrict the observer\u2019s  view.  The  tower  controller  assists  the  weather  observer  by  taking  a  visibility  observation  when  the  two  observing  locations  significantly  differ  in  their  visibility  values.  Your  local  weather station and tower controllers keep visibility charts which they use to assess visibility  values.   12.5.2.  Although the day observed horizontal visibility may be unrestricted, the pilot\u2019s slant  range visibility frequently  is restricted to  less than 7 statute miles  (SM).  In some  cases the  slant  range  visibility  can  be  as  little  as  one-half  of  the  reported  horizontal  visibility.  This  frequently happens when looking through fog, smoke, precipitation, dust, and haze because  the suspended particles scatter the sun\u2019s rays. If a purely visual approach is being attempted  with  no  attention  being  given  to  the  instruments,  glare  often  results  in  disguised  sink  rates  and other illusions. Under these conditions,  instruments  should be cross-checked closely to  ensure that optical illusions don\u2019t occur. To improve the slant range visibility, it is advisable"

            "text":"AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     131    to land with the sun to your back. These same problems may exist in a target region due to  smoke from burning targets, blowing sand, etc. To help minimize this problem, the weather  forecaster can provide sun angle and azimuth for any target location. Slant range visibility is  also a problem at night. Generally, a night flier will not see as far as a surface based observer  because  ground  based  nighttime  visibility  markers  are  easier  to  see  than  daytime  markers.  This is especially true in fog and light rain. Situations vary so you will have to depend on the  weather observer, the tower controller, or your own experience.   12.5.3.  Vertical visibility is the distance (in hundreds of feet) a weather forecaster can see in  an upward direction when the sky is totally obscured. This distance is usually determined by  weather instruments, but may be estimated by the observer if the equipment is inoperative. If  the  sky  is  partially  obscured,  no  vertical  visibility  value  is  reported.  If  the  sky  is  totally  obscured, the vertical visibility is reported with a numerical value in hundreds of feet.   12.6.  NVG\u2019s and Visibility.   12.6.1.  Air-crews using night vision goggles (NVG) are heavily dependent on the percent of  moon  illumination.  Each  weather  station  has  the  capability  of  running  light  programs  that  calculate the beginning and end of nautical and civil twilight, sunrise and sunset data, and the  percent of moon illumination. This information can be calculated for any geographic location  and  for  any  length  of  time  (number  of  days).  This  information  is  available  for  targets  and  destinations  anywhere  in  the  world.  Restrictions  to  normal  vision  may  be  detrimental  to  NVGs as well. Certainly, rain,  snow, fog,  clouds, smoke, haze, etc., will have some effect.  Follow manufacturer\u2019s guidance in anticipating the magnitude of reduction in night vision.   12.7.  Electro -Optical Data.   12.7.1.  Weather forecasters are frequently tasked to provide acquisition or lock-on ranges for  state-of-the-art weapons systems.  Infrared and TV guided systems are affected by the same  weather  conditions  that  affect  NVG\u2019s  and  normal  vision.  Weather  effects  on  electro-optic  sensors  are  based  on  atmospheric  effects  on  the  propagation  of  electromagnetic  energy.  Accurate information is based upon the actual contrast between targets and backgrounds both  in the visible and infrared spectrums.   12.7.2.  When the aircrew desires E-O information, it\u2019s necessary for the aircrew to provide  the  forecaster  with  as  much  information  about  the  target  as  possible.  This  information  includes,  but  may  not  be  limited  to:  time  over  target  (TOT),  run-in  heading,  flight  level,  target  size  (height,  width,  and  length),  target  composition  (concrete,  steel,  glass,  etc.),  heated/not,  type  of  weapon  being  used,  and  method  of  launching  and  steering  the  weapon.  With this information,  the weather forecaster should  be able to  provide  the acquisition  and  lock-on  range,  sun  elevation  and  azimuth  at  time  over  target,  length  of  shadows  around  target, \u2015what\u2019s hot, what\u2019s not\u2016 in the target picture, percent moon illumination, probability  of line-of-sight, and target area weather forecast.   12.8.  Cloud Ceilings.   12.8.1.  The ceiling is lowest layer above the Earth\u2019s surface reported as broken or overcast,  or the vertical visibility into a surface-based total obscuration. A ceiling can be composed of  interconnected layers or composed of a layer with numerous detached elements.   12.9.  Summation Principle.   \f  132    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   12.9.1.  In the US and Canada, the ceiling is determined by using the summation principle.  The summation principle states that the sky cover at any level is equal to the summation of  the  sky  cover  of  the  lowest  layer  plus  the  additional  sky  cover  present  at  all  successively  higher layers up to and including the layer being considered. A layer is clouds or obscuring  phenomena whose bases are approximately at the same level. If there is \u00bd of the sky covered  at 12,000 ft, and another \u00bc of the sky covered at 5,000 ft, the sky above the 5,000 ft layer is  assumed  to  also  have  clouds  at  12,000  ft.    This  would  then  result  in  \u00be  of  the  sky  covered  with cloud and a BKN ceiling at 12,000 ft. The AMOS derives sky condition instrumentally  by detecting the frequency and height of clouds passing over the sensor (ceilometer) over a  period  of  30  minutes.  An  algorithm  then  processes  the  data  from  the  sensor  into  data  on  layers, amounts, and heights of clouds.   12.10.  METAR Cloud Cover.   12.10.1.  In METAR code, the following terms are used to reflect the degree of cloudiness in  sky condition evaluations.   12.10.1.1.  CLR--Means  \u2015Clear\u2016  or  the  absence  of  layers  of  clouds  or  other  obscuring  phenomena. Transmitted as \u2015CLR\u2016 at manual weather stations when there are no clouds,  and at automated stations when no clouds are at or below 12,000 feet or 25,000 feet when  the  25K  algorithm  is  used.  NOTE:  At  civilian  locations,  SKC  shall  be  used  at  manual  locations when no layers are reported.   12.10.1.2.  FEW--Means \u2015Few\u2016 or greater than 0/8 up to 2/8 cloud coverage.   12.10.1.3.  SCT--Means \u2015Scattered\u2016 or 3/8 to 4/8 cloud coverage.   12.10.1.4.  BKN--Means \u2015Broken\u2016 or 5/8 to 7/8 cloud coverage.   12.10.1.5.  OVC--Means \u2015Overcast\u2016 or the sky is totally covered with clouds (8/8).   12.10.2.  In  METAR  code  the  lowest  cloud  layer  prefixed  with  the  contraction  \u2015BKN\u2016  or  \u2015OVC\u2016  designates  the  ceiling.  \u2015VV\u2016  will  be  encoded  when  there  is  a  ground  based  obstruction completely blocking the sky.   12.10.3.  In  METAR  a  partial  surface  obscuration  is  reported  as  \u2015FEW000,  SCT000,  or  BKN000.\u2016 At manual observing airfields the partial obscuration may be clarified in remarks  such as \u2015FG FEW000,\u2016 \u2015FU SCT000,\u2016 or \u2015DU BKN000.\u2016 Automated sensors are limited in  their ability to detect partial obscurations.   12.11.  Foreign Ceilings.   12.11.1.  As  with  visibility,  some  countries  have  established  different  criteria  regarding  the  amount of sky cover required to constitute a ceiling. When flying in a foreign country using  their  weather  conditions,  aircrews  must  ask  the  local  weather  office  to  determine  exactly  what ceiling criteria is used.   12.12.  Surface Obscuration.   12.12.1.  To be classified as obscuring phenomena, precipitation, smoke, haze, fog, or other  visibility  restricting  conditions  must  extend  upward  from  the  surface.  An  obscured  sky  occurs  when  the  sky  is  totally  hidden  from  an  observer  on  the  ground.  The  ceiling  will  be  reported as the vertical visibility from the ground upward into the obstruction. For example,   \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     133    when the sky is totally hidden by fog and the ground observer can see upward for 600 feet,  the ceiling will be reported as \u2015VV006\u2016.   12.12.2.  It is important to note the difference between the obstruction ceiling of 600 feet and  a  cloud  ceiling  of  600  feet.  With  a  low  cloud  ceiling,  the  aircrew  normally  will  see  the  ground and the runway after descending to a level below the cloud base. However, with an  obscured ceiling, the obscuring phenomenon restricts visibility between the reported altitude  and the ground, and the slant range visibility is greatly reduced. Aircrews will not normally  be able to see the runway or approach lights  clearly, even after penetrating the level of the  reported obstruction ceiling.   12.12.3.  With  a  partially  obscured  sky,  clouds  or  part  of  the  sky  can  be  seen  above  the  obscuring  phenomenon.  A  partial  obstruction  does  not  define  a  ceiling.  However,  a  cloud  layer  above  a  partial  obstruction  may  constitute  a  ceiling.  Partially  obscured  skies  also  present  a  slant  range  visibility  problem  for  aircrews  on  approach,  but  usually  to  a  lesser  degree than a total  obstruction. From directly overhead, the aircrew may be able to  see the  runway clearly, whereas the slant range visibility on final approach could be poor.   12.13.  Fog.   12.13.1.  Fog  is  one  of  the  most  common  and  persistent  weather  hazards  encountered  in  aviation, and the most frequent cause of prevailing visibility less than three miles. Since fog  occurs at  the surface, it is  primarily  a hazard during takeoff and landing.  Above fog, flight  visibility is generally good.   12.13.2.  Fog  is  a  surface-based  cloud  composed  of  either  water  droplets  or  ice  crystals.  Since fog normally forms in very stable air, there are few collisions between the droplets or  ice crystals.  The droplets remain extremely small, so before significantly reducing visibility,  a large number of suspended droplets must be present.   12.13.2.1.  Ideal atmospheric conditions for fog formation are:  12.13.2.2.  Small temperature dew point spread (5oF or less)   12.13.2.3.  Abundant condensation nuclei   12.13.2.4.  Light surface wind   12.13.2.5.  Cooling land surfaces, warmer air above (i.e, air is cooled from below)   12.14.  Radiation Fog.   12.14.1.  Radiation  fog  is  a  relatively  shallow  fog  resulting  from  radiational  cooling  of  the  ground  on  clear,  calm  nights.  The  ground  cools  the  air  in  contact  with  it  to  the  dew  point  temperature  producing  fog.  Ground  fog  (Figure  12.4)  is  a  form  of  radiation  fog.  It  forms  almost exclusively at night or in the early morning and usually disappears a few hours after  sunrise. Radiation fog is very shallow when there is no wind. Light wind, usually less than 5  kts, produces a slight mixing of the air. This tends to deepen the fog by spreading the cooled  air  through  a  deeper  layer.  Stronger  winds  disperse  the  fog  or  mix  the  air  through  a  still  deeper layer with stratus forming at the top of the mixing layer.   \f  134    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 12.4.  Ground Fog.   12.15.  Advection Fog.   12.15.1.  Common  along  coastal  areas,  advection  fog  forms  when  moist  air  moves  over  colder  ground  or  water.  When  it  forms  over  a  large  body  of  water,  it  is  called  sea  fog.  Advection fog deepens with increasing wind speed (ideally between 3-9kts). Winds stronger  than 10 kts usually lift the fog into a layer of low stratus or stratocumulus. Advection fog can  stay over water for weeks moving over land late in the day and moving over the water the  next morning.   12.15.2.  The west coast of the United States is quite vulnerable to advection fog and stratus.  This  common  fog  forms  offshore,  largely  as  a  result  of  upwelling--very  cold  water  rising  from the ocean depths to the surface (Figure 12.5). The resulting cold air is carried inland by  the wind as stratus or fog. Advection fog over the southeastern United States and along the  Gulf Coast results from moist tropical air moving over cold ground, for this reason, it is more  frequent in winter than summer. Airfields located downwind from cold, freshwater lakes can  experience frequent bouts with advection fog during the summer months.     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     135    Figure 12.5.  Stratus and Fog off the West Coast of the United States.   12.16.  Precipitation Induced Fog.   12.16.1.  When relatively warm rain or drizzle falls through cool, unsaturated air, evaporation  from the precipitation  cools the air further and saturates it, often resulting in fog formation  (Figure 12.6). Precipitation induced fog can become quite dense and extend over large areas.  It  may  form  rapidly  and  continue  for  an  extended  period  of  time.    This  is  often  associated  with  approaching  frontal  systems  and  may  be  referred  to  as  frontal  fog.  Frontal  fog  forms  from the evaporation of warm precipitation as it falls into drier, colder air in a frontal system.  Pre-frontal, or warm-frontal, fog is the most common and often occurs over widespread areas  ahead  of  warm  fronts.  Whenever  the  rain  temperature  exceeds  the  wet-bulb  temperature  of  the cold air, fog or stratus form. Fog usually dissipates after frontal passage due to increasing  temperatures and surface winds. Post-frontal, or cold-frontal, fog occurs less frequently than  warm-frontal  fog.  Slow-moving,  shallow-sloped  cold  fronts,  characterized  by  vertically  decreasing winds through the frontal surface, produce persistent, widespread areas of fog and  stratus clouds 150 to 250 miles behind the surface frontal position.     \f  136    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 12.6.  Precipitation-Induced Fog.   12.17.  Upslope Fog.   12.17.1.  Moist, stable air that cools as it moves up sloping terrain forms upslope fog (Figure  12.7). It is often quite dense and extends to high elevations. This type occurs when sloping  terrain lifts air, cooling it adiabatically to its dew point and saturation. Upslope fog may be  viewed as either a stratus cloud or fog, depending on the point of reference of the observer.  Upslope fog generally forms at the higher elevations and builds downward into valleys. This  fog can maintain itself at higher wind speeds because of increased lift and adiabatic cooling.  Upslope  winds  more  than  10  to  12  knots  usually  result  in  stratus  rather  than  fog.  The  east  slope of the Rocky Mountains is a prime location for this type of fog.   Figure 12.7.  Upslope Fog.       \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     137    12.18.  Freezing Fog.   12.18.1.  Freezing  fog  occurs  when  the  water  droplets  that  the  fog  is  composed  of  are  \"supercooled\".  Supercooled  water  droplets  remain  in  the  liquid  state  until  they  come  into  contact with  a surface upon which they can freeze. As a result, any object the freezing fog  comes into contact with will become coated with ice. The same thing happens with freezing  rain or drizzle.. Conditions favorable for formation are the same as for radiation fog except  that  the  temperature  is  usually  much  colder  than  32oF.  Freezing  fog  frequently  forms  very  rapidly in the exhaust gasses of aircraft engines. If there is little or no wind, it is possible for  an  aircraft  to  generate  enough  freezing  fog  during  takeoff  or  landing  to  cover  the  runway,  halting  further  aircraft  operations.  Ice  fog  may  persist  for  periods  which  vary  from  a  few  minutes to several days.   12.19.  Ice Fog.   12.19.1.  Ice  fog  occurs  when  the  temperature  is  below  -30\u00b0C  (-22\u00b0F)  and  water  vapor  deposits  as  ice  crystals.    This  type  of  fog  forms  when  the  air  temperature  is  well  below  freezing and is  composed entirely of tiny ice crystals  that are suspended  in  the air.  Ice fog  will only be witnessed in cold Arctic / Polar air.   12.20.  Stratus.   12.20.1.  Like  fog,  stratus  clouds  are  composed  of  extremely  small  water  droplets  or  ice  crystals suspended in the air. Stratus differs from fog due to its location above the ground and  not reducing the horizontal visibility at the surface. As a portion of the sun\u2019s energy warms  the Earth\u2019s surface, the fog lifts into an elevated low stratus layer. Because of the reduction in  upward visibility, the observer on the ground recognizes the condition as stratus. Both slant  range visibility and flight visibility may approach zero in stratus, depending on the cloud\u2019s  density and depth.   12.21.  Haze.   12.21.1.  Haze  is  a  concentration  of  suspended  salt,dust  or  pollutant  particles.  It  occurs  in  stable air and is usually only a few thousand feet thick, but may sometimes extend as high as  15,000 feet. A haze layer often has a well defined top and good horizontal visibility above.  However,  downward  visibility  from  above  a  haze  layer  is  poor,  especially  on  a  slant.  Visibility in haze varies greatly, depending upon whether the aircrew is facing into or away  from the sun. Landing or taking off into the sun is often hazardous if haze is present.   12.22.  Smoke and Smog.   12.22.1.  Smoke concentrations form primarily in industrial areas in stable air. Smog is when  smoke  and  fog  occur  together.  Smog  also  causes  very  poor  visibility  (Figure  12.8).  Large  scale air stagnation is required for smog formation. Some geographic areas chronically suffer  from reduced visibilities due to smog and smoke. The aerosols cannot disperse through the  atmosphere  because  an  inversion  prevents  smog  dissipation.  Severe  smog  conditions  can  reduce prevailing visibilities to less than one mile.   \f  138    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 12.8.  Haze and Smog.   12.23.  Blowing Dust and Sand.   12.23.1.  In areas with loose, dry soil, blowing dust occurs in strong winds and unstable air  (Figure 12.9). The wind and vertical currents may spread the dust over a wide area and often  lift it to great heights. Very small dust particles may remain suspended for several days once  airborne.  Both  blowing  dust  and  suspended  dust  reduce  surface,  flight,  and  slant  visibility  ranges to very low values. Blowing sand is more local than blowing dust. It occurs in deserts  where the wind lifts loose sand and blows it in clouds or sheets. In its extreme form, blowing  sand may become a sandstorm and restrict visibility to near zero (Figure 12.10).     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     139    Figure 12.9.  Satellite shot of Blowing Dust.   Figure 12.10.  Blowing Sand.   12.23.2.  Helicopter  induced  \u2015brownout\u2016  is  a  dangerous  phenomena  experienced  by  many  helicopters  when  making  landing  approaches  or  takeoffs  in  dusty  environments,  whereby  sand or dust particles become swept up in the rotor outwash and obscure the pilot\u2019s vision of  the  terrain.    This  is  particularly  dangerous  because  the  pilot  needs  visual  cues  from  their  surroundings in order to make a safe landing or takeoff.  Flying is not recommended when  the environment is conducive to brownout conditions       \f  140    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   12.24.  Snow/Blowing Snow.   12.24.1.  Falling snow can reduce visibilities dependent upon the intensity.  The extend of the  degradation depends on if there are any other restrictors occurring at the same time.  General  estimations are that light snow showers will reduce visibilities to greater than \u00bd statute mile.   It  is  common  that  visibilities  will  reduced  to  greater  than  \u00bc  statute  miles  but  less  than  \u00bd  statute miles, while heavy snowfall can reduce visibilities below \u00bc statute mile.  Visibilities  may be reduced further if other obscurations such as fog occur with the snowfall.   12.24.2.  Loose  snow  becomes  blowing  snow  at  wind  speeds  of  10  to  15  knots  or  greater.   Although  any  blowing  snow  restricts  visibility,  the  amount  of  the  visibility  restriction  depends on such factors as terrain, wind speed, snow depth, and composition. Blowing snow  is  also  troublesome.  Strong  winds  keep  the  snow  suspended  up  to  50  feet  and/or  reduce  visibility at ground level to near zero. When the snow is blowing to great heights, the sky can  become partially obscured. Blowing snow, falling snow, and strong winds make for a tricky  combination and can reduce visibilities for hours in a heavy snow or lake effect snowshower  situation. Ceilings and visibilities can vary quite rapidly in snow situations. Visibility of less  than 1/4 mile is not unusual in light or moderate snow when the winds exceed 25 knots. The  composition  of the snow and the effects  of local  terrain  are as important  as meteorological  factors  in  forecasting  visibility  reductions  caused  by  blowing  snow.  Blowing  snow  is  a  greater hazard to flying operations in polar regions than in mid-latitudes because the colder  snow is dry, fine, and easily lifted. Winds may raise the snow 1,000 feet above the  ground  and lower visibility. A frequent  and sudden increase in surface winds in polar regions may  cause the visibility to drop from unlimited to near zero within a few minutes.   12.24.3.  Helicopter  induced  \u2015whiteout\u2016  is  a  dangerous  phenomena  experienced  by  many  helicopters  when  making  landing  approaches  or  takeoffs  in  snow  or  ice  covered  areas,  whereby snow or ice crystals particles become swept up in the rotor outwash and obscure the  pilot\u2019s vision of the terrain. There are no shadows, no horizon or clouds and all depth-of-field  and  orientation  are  lost.  A  whiteout  situation  is  severe  in  that  there  aren't  any  visual  references.  Flying  is  not  recommended  when  the  environment  is  conducive  to  whiteout  conditions.   12.25.  Drizzle.   12.25.1.  Drizzle  usually  restricts  visibility  to  a  greater  degree  than  rain.  Drizzle  falls  in  stable air and is  usually  accompanied by  fog. When drizzle changes to  light  rain,  visibility  usually  improves  and  the  droplet  size  increases.  The  droplet  size  increase  means  there  are  fewer droplets per unit area thus improving the visibility.   12.26.  Rain.   12.26.1.  Visibilities  are  limited  based  on  precipitation  types  and  intensities.    Light  rain  showers will show a degradation of visibility to 5 statute miles and moderate rain showers to  2 \u00bd statute miles.  Heavy rain showers can limit visibilities to less than \u00bd statute mile.  Rain  will also limit cockpit visibility. When rain streams over the aircraft windshield, freezes on it,  or fogs over the inside surface, it greatly reduces the aircrew\u2019s visibility.   \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     141    Chapter 13   THUNDERSTORMS AND ASSOCIATED HAZARDS   13.1.  Introduction.  Thunderstorms contain the most severe weather hazards to flight. Many are  accompanied  by  strong  winds,  severe  icing  and  turbulence,  frequent  lightning,  heavy  rain,  and  hazardous  windshear.  If  all  of  these  are  not  enough,  consider  the  possibility  of  large  hail,  microbursts,  and  even  tornadoes.  The  latent  heat  released  by  a  moderate  thunderstorm  is  equivalent to the energy of a 400 kiloton nuclear explosion! This chapter presents hazards a pilot  must consider when flying in the vicinity of, or actually entering, a thunderstorm. Being familiar  with these factors will help  you better understand what is going on both inside and outside the  cockpit.   13.1.1.  The best advice if thunderstorms are forecast or have already formed is: DON\u2019T FLY  IN OR NEAR THEM! Unfortunately, with about 44,000 thunderstorms occurring daily over  the  surface  of  the  Earth,  almost  every  aircrew  can  expect  to  encounter  one  occasionally.  There  are  flights  when  you  simply  cannot  avoid  flying  in  the  vicinity  of  thunderstorms,  especially  when  widespread  large  areas.  Knowledge  of  thunderstorms  form  over  thunderstorm  characteristics  and  the  application  of  tested  procedures  will  help  aircrews  fly  more safely when thunderstorms are present.   13.2.  Thunderstorm Information.   13.2.1.  The  weather  forecaster  is  the  best  source  for  obtaining  thunderstorm  information  during  the  preflight  weather  briefing.  During  flight,  en-route  thunderstorm  avoidance  can  sometimes  be  provided  by  the  Air  Route  Traffic  Control  Center  (ARTCC).  Many  en-route  information sources are periodically updated to reflect the latest thunderstorm advisories and  warnings  in  effect.  The  Automatic  Terminal  Information  Service  (ATIS),  Transcribed  Weather Broadcast (TWEB), and Hazardous In-flight Advisory Service (HIWAS) are a few  such weather sources. Aircraft weather radar can be used to avoid thunderstorms but should  not be used to determine thunderstorm intensity. Therefore, it is advisable to obtain weather  information from a weather station that has a pilot-to-metro service (PMSV) capability.   13.3.  Thunderstorm Formation.   13.3.1.  Thunderstorms  can  form  in  any  weather  environment  if  the  right  \u2015ingredients\u2016  are  present. In some tropical regions, thunderstorms occur year round. In the mid-latitudes, they  develop  most  frequently  in  spring,  summer,  and  fall.  Thunderstorms  can  even  form  in  the  Arctic regions during their summer months.  Figure  13.1 shows the average annual number  of days  with  thunderstorms  in  the United States.  Note they  are most  frequent  in  the south- central  and  southeastern  states  with  Florida  having  the  greatest  number  of  thunderstorms.  The number of days a thunderstorm occurs varies with the season as shown in Figure 13.2.   \f  142    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 13.1.  Average Number of Days with Thunderstorms Each Year.   Figure 13.2.  Average Number of Days with Thunderstorms Seasonal.   13.3.2.  The basic requirements for thunderstorm (cumulonimbus) formation  are:   moisture,  unstable  air,  and  some  type  of  lifting  action.  Lifted  warm  air  does  not  always  result  in  thunderstorm activity. Air may be lifted to a point where the moisture condenses and clouds  form, but these clouds may not grow significantly unless the air parcel reaches a point where  it will continue to rise freely (the level of free convection or LFC). This  happens when the       \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     143    condensing  air  produces  a  locally  warmer  air  pocket  than  its  surrounding  area.  When  the  warmer air rises on its own, the air has become unstable. The higher the moisture content, the  easier the LFC is reached. Once a cloud forms, the released heat caused by the changing state  from  vapor  to  liquid  tends  to  make  the  cloud  area  warmer  than  its  surrounding  air  environment.  This  destabilizes  the  air.  When  the  rising  air  is  much  warmer  than  its"

            "text":"surrounding environment, it quickly forms towering cumulus and eventually cumulonimbus  clouds.  The  degree  of  vertical  cloud  growth  often  indicates  the  potential  severity  of  the  thunderstorm. Rapidly growing towering cumulus clouds indicates very unstable conditions  and can develop into severe thunderstorms. As it rises, the warmed unstable air cools but at a  slower  rate  than  its  surrounding  environment.  Eventually  the  air  parcel  reaches  an  altitude  where  it  becomes  the  same  temperature  as  its  surroundings.  The  air  parcel  slows  vertical  development  reaching  an  equilibrium  level  where  the  air  parcel  temperature  and  its  surrounding environment temperature are the same. Some type of lifting action is necessary  to force warmer air from its lower level to a level where the warmed air will continue to rise  freely. Normally, mountainous terrain, fronts, heating from below, or convergence (upward  vertical motions associated with air coming together from different directions) provides the  necessary lifting action. Once the necessary lifting action allows towering cumulus to form,  they\u2019ll form repeatedly throughout the thunderstorm life cycle.   13.4.  Thunderstorm Life Cycle.   13.4.1.  During  its  life  cycle,  a  thunderstorm  progresses  through  three  stages:  cumulus  (growth),  mature,  and  dissipating.  All  thunderstorms  go  through  this  life  cycle  with  some  progressing  through  all  three  stages  in  an  hour  or  less  while  other  storms  can  last  several  hours. Furthermore, a thunderstorm may consist of a cluster of cells each in different stages  of  the  life  cycle  giving  the  appearance  of  a  continuous,  long-lasting  single  storm.  All  thunderstorms  start  out  in  the  cumulus  cloud  stage.  The  main  feature  of  the  cumulus  stage  (Figure 13.3) is the updraft which may extend from near the surface to several thousand feet  above  the  visible  cloud  top.  In  the  latter  part  of  this  stage,  the  greatest  updraft  occurs  at  higher  altitudes  and  may  reach  3,000  feet  or  more  per  minute.  As  the  cloud  forms,  water  vapor changes to liquid and/or frozen cloud particles. This releases heat providing energy to  the developing cloud. After other forces form the cloud, this continuous heat release process  helps the cumulus cloud to rise and grow. During this early period, cloud droplets are very  small but grow into raindrops as the cloud builds. In the upper levels, snow and ice particles  exist, although in the updraft, raindrops remain liquid to heights far above the freezing level,  sometimes reaching 40,000 feet. Since ascending air currents carry or suspend raindrops and  ice particles, there is usually no precipitation during this stage.   into  a   towering  cumulus  (TCU)  and  eventual  13.4.2.  A  cumulus  cloud  forming  cumulonimbus  (CB)  marks  the  mature  stage.  The  mature  stage  is  characterized  by  updraft  and  downdraft  development.  When  updrafts  can  no  longer  support  the  raindrops  and  ice  particles in the cloud, a downdraft develops and precipitation and/or hail begin falling from  the  cloud  base.  By  this  time,  the  average  cell  has  grown  to  25,000  feet,  has  crossed  the  freezing  level,  and  has  developed  lightning.  Empirical  studies  have  shown  that  when  a  thunderstorm  vertically  develops  above  the  -20\u00b0C  isotherm  and  contains  large  amounts  of  graupel in that layer, lightning formation is likely. As rain starts falling, evaporation cools the  surrounding  air  and  the  air  parcel  begins  to  sink.  Since  it  is  unstable,  the  cold,  dense  air  accelerates, forming a downdraft which may reach 2,500 feet per minute (Figure 13.3). The   \f  144    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   downdraft spreads outward near the surface, producing a sharp temperature drop and strong,  gusty, surface winds. The leading edge of this wind is called the gust front and often pushes  ahead of the thunderstorm by several miles. The gust front is characterized by gusty winds,  sharp  temperature  drops,  low  level  windshear,  and  turbulence.  In  the  early  mature  stage,  remaining  updrafts  continue  increasing  in  speed  and  may  exceed  4,500  feet  per  minute.  Updrafts and downdrafts occur near each other creating strong, vertical shear and turbulence.  The  mature  stage  marks  the  maximum  intensity  of  the  thunderstorms.  If  severe  weather  develops, it will most likely form during this stage.   Figure 13.3.  Stages of a Thunderstorm.   13.4.3.  Occasionally, severe thunderstorms do not dissipate through the classic mature stage.  Instead, strong upper level winds prolong the mature stage and a considerable tilt develops in  the updraft/downdraft couplet within the cloud. In this situation, much stronger updrafts and  downdrafts  may  enable  the  storm  to  become  a  supercell.  Supercell  thunderstorms  cause  severe weather and should be avoided. Sometimes  the optimal combination and orientation  of lower atmosphere vertical wind shear, low-level moisture, and high instability allows large  Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSs) to develop.  These systems may last 6 to 8 hours or  more and typically form at night as the nocturnal low-level jet stream strengthens.  They may  last into the following morning and trigger flash flooding events.   13.4.4.  Throughout  the  mature  stage,  downdrafts  strengthen  while  updrafts  weaken.  The  storm\u2019s  cooled  air  rushes  downward  resulting  in  the  entire  thunderstorm  cell  becoming  an  area of downdrafts (Figure 13.3). The cooled, stable air advances into formerly warm, moist  air  environments  effectively  cutting  off  the  storm\u2019s  supply  of  energy.  Since  updrafts  are  necessary  to  produce  condensation  and  latent  heat  energy,  the  thunderstorm  begins  to  dissipate.  If  severe  weather  has  formed,  it  will  also  dissipate  during  this  stage.  Maximum  tornado intensity, the strongest surface winds and largest hail are experienced during the first  part of the dissipation stage. Strong winds aloft may develop the upper levels of the CB into  the familiar anvil shape.   13.5.  The Tropopause and Thunderstorms.     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     145    13.5.1.  The  height  of  the  tropopause  is  important  when  analyzing  potential  severity  of  a  thunderstorm. The tropopause height will vary with latitude and the season of the year. The  tropopause height is higher in summer and lower in winter. The height is also higher at the  equator and lower at higher latitudes. The tropopause acts as a barrier to resist the exchange  of air between the troposphere and the stratosphere.   13.5.2.  The tropopause will prevent a thunderstorm from continuing to build, acting as a lid  on  further  vertical  development.  Only  the  most  severe  thunderstorms  with  rapidly  rising  updrafts have enough kinetic energy to penetrate the tropopause before cooling and slowing  down.  Remember  that  the  tropopause  height  does  change  seasonally  and  regionally.  A  springtime  30,000-foot  thunderstorm  in  Germany  is  potentially  as  deadly  as  a  50,000-foot  mid-west US thunderstorm in summertime. There is a rough correlation between the degree  of tropopause penetration and thunderstorm severity: the greater the tropopause penetration,  the more severe the storm.   13.6.  Frontal Thunderstorms.   13.6.1.  Thunderstorms can occur with any type of front: warm, cold, stationary, or occluded.  Frontal surfaces provide the lifting mechanism to force air upward. Warm, moist, unstable air  lifted  over  a  frontal  surface  causes  frontal  thunderstorms.  Thunderstorms  may  also  occur  many miles ahead of rapidly moving cold fronts with squall lines.   13.6.2.  Stratiform clouds usually accompany warm fronts due the shallowness of the frontal  slope.  Thunderstorms  caused  by  moist  unstable  air  riding  over  the  warm  front  may  be  obscured unless aircrews fly above the stratiform layer. If flying at low levels, aircrews may  be forewarned of such conditions by loud crashes of static in their headsets. Because of the  front\u2019s shallow slope, warm frontal thunderstorms are usually the least severe of all frontal  thunderstorms (Figure 13.4).   13.6.3.  Thunderstorms  associated  with  cold  fronts  are  the  most  severe,  except  for  those  found in squall lines. The cold frontal surface wedges the warm unstable air upward until the  forced air rises on its own. Often cold frontal thunderstorms form into a continuous line and  are easy to recognize (Figure 13.5).   \f  146    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 13.4.  Warm Front Thunderstorm.   Figure 13.5.  Cold Front Thunderstorm.   13.6.4.  Occasionally, thunderstorms develop along a stationary front, where they are usually  scattered. These thunderstorms can form in the same areas for days dumping heavy rains and  causing flooding. Stationary frontal  storms usually move slowly  and can plague an  airfield  for hours with inclement weather.   13.6.5.  Thunderstorms associated with occluded fronts are particularly dangerous to aircrews  since  they  are  often  embedded  in  stratiform  clouds  and  difficult  to  see.  Occluded  frontal       \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     147    thunderstorms  form  along  the  mixed  frontal  surfaces  with  the  overlapping  frontal  surfaces  forcing the unstable air aloft. The forced air eventually reaches the height where the air rises  on  its  own  and  goes  through  the  thunderstorm  development  cycle.  Occluded  frontal  thunderstorms can achieve the same severity as their cold front cousins.   13.6.6.  A  squall  line  is  a  non-frontal,  narrow  band  of  active,  occasionally  violent,  thunderstorms.  Squall  lines  often  develop  50  to  300  miles  ahead  of  rapidly  moving  cold  fronts in moist, unstable air (Figure 13.6), but the existence of a front is not a prerequisite. A  squall  line  may  be  too  long  to  easily  detour  around  or  too  wide  or  severe  to  penetrate.  Remember  from  Chapter  8  that  squall  lines  have  moderate  to  extreme  turbulence,  strong  windshear, frequent lightning, possible hail, and tornadoes. They can achieve forward speeds  of 50 knots or more. Figure 13.7 provides an aerial view of an advancing squall line.   Figure 13.6.  Squall Line.     \f  148    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 13.7.  Squall Line Thunderstorms.   13.7.  Air Mass Thunderstorms.   13.7.1.  Air mass thunderstorms form within a warm, moist, unstable air mass not associated  with  a  front.  They  are  generally  isolated  or  widely  scattered  over  a  large  area  with  no  apparent  organized  activity.  These  thunderstorms  receive  their  necessary  lift  by  surface  heating (convection), convergence of low level  winds,  or winds forcing the moist,  unstable  air up mountain slopes. Since they are caused by surface heating and convergence, they reach  maximum intensity and frequency over land during middle and late afternoon. Along coastal  regions they reach a maximum during the night  and early morning when the warmer water  heats  the  cool  air  flowing  off  the  land,  causing  thunderstorms  to  form  a  short  distance  offshore.   13.8.  Orographic Thunderstorms.   13.8.1.  Orographic thunderstorms will form  on the windward side of a  mountain  when the  prevailing wind forces moist, unstable air up the slope. The storm activity is usually scattered  along the individual mountain peaks, but occasionally there will be a long, unbroken line of  thunderstorms.  The  storms  frequently  enshroud  the  mountain  peaks  and  adjacent  lower  terrain. Orographic stationary thunderstorms can have dangerous flash flooding as evidenced  by the Big Thompson Canyon Flood, Colorado, in July 1976. These orographically stationary  storms topped 60,000 feet and dumped an estimated 10 inches of rain in a 2 hour period.   13.9.  Thunderstorm Turbulence.     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     149    13.9.1.  Severe  turbulence  and  icing,  heavy  precipitation,  lightning,  windshear,  and  gusty  surface winds may accompany thunderstorms. These hazards are so common they appear on  the  front  of  every  DD  Form  l75-1,  Flight  Weather  Briefing.  Severe  thunderstorms  may  produce large hail, damaging winds, and sometimes tornadoes.   13.9.2.  Hazardous turbulence is present in all thunderstorms, and in a severe thunderstorm it  can damage the airframe and cause serious injury to passengers and crew. The most violent  turbulence  occurs  in  the  shear  between  updrafts  and  downdrafts.  Outside  the  cloud,  shear  turbulence has been encountered several thousand feet above and as much as 20 miles from a  severe storm. Severe turbulence can occur in the anvil 15 to 30 miles downwind. Remember,  the  storm  cloud  is  only  the  visible  portion  of  a  turbulent  system.  Updrafts  and  downdrafts  often extend outside the storm proper.   13.9.3.  The shear zone between the cold air downdraft and surrounding air forms a low level  turbulent area. When the shear zone reaches the surface and spreads out laterally ahead of the  storm,  it\u2019s  called  a  gust-front.  It  often  occurs  20  or  more  miles  ahead  of  a  mature  storm.  Thunderstorms with multiple downdrafts may form second or third gust fronts between the  first and the cloud base. On average, horizontal wind direction changes 40 percent across the  gust front, and wind speed may increase 50 percent between the surface and 1,500 feet. Thus,  surface observations may not give a true estimate of the actual wind just above the surface.   13.9.4.  A roll cloud on the leading edge of a storm often indicates eddies associated with this  shear.  The  roll  cloud  is  most  prevalent  with  cold  front  or  squall  line  thunderstorms  and  indicates  an  extremely  turbulent  zone.  The  first  gust  causes  a  rapid  and  sometimes  drastic  change in surface wind ahead of an approaching storm.   13.10.  Thunderstorm Icing.   13.10.1.  Where the free air temperatures are at or below freezing, icing should be expected.  In general, icing is associated with temperatures from 0\u00b0C to -20\u00b0C. The most severe icing  occurs  from  0\u00b0C  to  -10\u00b0C,  with  the  worst  icing  conditions  usually  found  just  above  the  freezing level between 0\u00b0C and -5\u00b0C. Since the freezing level is also the zone where heavy  rainfall and turbulence most frequently occur, this particular altitude appears to be the most  hazardous.   13.10.2.  Hailstones are solid spheres of ice or irregular frozen conglomerates originating in  the  updraft/downdraft  couplet  of  thunderstorms.  Supercell  thunderstorms  contain  enormous  updrafts  and  downdrafts  that  permit  large  hailstones  to  grow  by  accretion  over  periods  of  many minutes. Hailstones can be spherical, conical, or quite irregular in shape (Figure l3.8).  Hailstones are often tossed out of the chimney-effect updraft into downdrafts where the ice  commences its descent as a potentially damaging missile. Baseball and softball sized hail is  often  reported  with  severe  thunderstorms.  Hailstorms  have  been  known  to  precipitate  hail  measured  over  a  foot  deep.  As  a  general  rule,  the  larger  the  storm,  the  more  likely  it  is  to  have hail. Hail has been encountered as high as 45,000 feet in completely clear air and may  be carried up to 20 miles downwind from the storm core.   \f  150    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 13.8.  7 \u00bd inch Diameter Hail.   13.11.  Thunderstorm Hail.   13.11.1.  The largest hailstone measured in the United States weighed nearly two pounds and  was 18\u00bd  inches in circumference. Imagine the devastation to your aircraft if you were to fly  through even softball-sized hail! Hailstones larger than \u00bd to \u00be of an inch cause significant  aircraft damage in a few seconds. Figure 13.9 shows photographs of aircraft damaged after  flights through hail.   Figure 13.9.  Hail Damage to Aircraft.       \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     151    13.12.  Thunderstorm Lightning.   13.12.1.  Lightning  occurs  at  all  levels  in  a  thunderstorm.  The  majority  of  lightning  discharges  never  strike  the  ground  but  occur  between  clouds  or  within  a  cloud  (Figure  13.10). Lightning also occurs in the clear air around the top, sides and bottoms of storms. The  proverbial \u2015bolt out of the blue\u2016 (Figure 13.11) can still strike aircrews flying miles from a  thunderstorm.   Figure 13.10.  Lightning Variations.       \f  152    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 13.11.  Lightning Bolt \u2015Out of the Blue\u2016.   13.12.2.  Electrostatic discharges are very similar to natural lightning but are triggered by the  aircraft  itself.  Electrical  charges  build  up  on  aircraft  when  they  fly  through  clouds  or  precipitation  (liquid  or  frozen)  or  even  solid  particles  such  as  dust,  haze,  and  ice.  The  aircraft\u2019s electrical field may then interact with charged areas of the atmosphere resulting in  an electrostatic discharge. This discharge does not have to occur in a thunderstorm. Aircraft  have reported damage from electrostatic discharges occurring in cirrus downwind of previous  thunderstorm activity, in cumulus around a thunderstorm\u2019s periphery, and even in stratiform  clouds and light rain showers. Electrostatic discharges usually cause minor physical damage  and indirect effects such as electrical circuit upsets.   13.12.3.  Lightning  strikes  and  electrostatic  discharges  are  the  leading  causes  of  reportable  weather  related  aircraft  accidents  and  incidents  in  the  Air  Force.  They  are  encountered  at  nearly all temperatures and altitudes and affect all types of aircraft. Aircraft are struck or can  trigger strikes in two types of weather conditions: electrically active clouds (thunderstorms)  and electrically inactive (non-thunderstorm) clouds.   13.12.4.  Research  aircraft  have  shown  that  penetration  of  the  upper  reaches  of  a  thunderstorm (35-40,000 feet with temperatures less than -40oC) provides one of the greatest  potentials  for  strikes  and  discharges.  The  majority  of  Air  Force  and  commercial  airline  incidents, however, occur at lower altitudes in non-thunderstorm clouds and in areas outside  of  active  thunderstorm  cells.  Aircraft  probably  trigger  strikes  and  discharges  of  this  type  since they would not occur naturally without the aircraft. In most of these cases the aircraft  operates in one or more of the following conditions:  13.12.4.1.  Within 8oC of the freezing level.   13.12.4.2.  Within 5,000 feet of the freezing level.   13.12.4.3.  In light precipitation (including snow).   13.12.4.4.  In clouds (including debris clouds).     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     153    13.12.4.5.  In light or negligible turbulence.   13.12.5.  Lightning  strikes  and  electrostatic  discharges  have  varied  effects  on  aircraft  and  aircrews.  Usually,  structural  damage  is  minor  but  sometimes  severe  structural  damage  can  occur (Figure 13.12). Damage to aircraft electrical systems, instruments, avionics, and radar  is also possible. Transient voltages and currents induced in the aircraft electrical systems, as  well  as  direct  lightning  strikes,  have  caused  bomb  doors  to  open,  activated  wing  folding  motors, and made the accuracy of electronic flight control navigational systems questionable.  After  an  electrostatic  discharge  or  a  lightning  strike,  consider  all  instruments  invalid  until  proper operation is verified.   Figure 13.12.  Major Structural Damage Resulting from Lightning Strike.   13.12.6.  Aircrews are not immune to the effects of lightning strikes. Flash blindness can last  up to 30 seconds, and the shock wave can cause some temporary hearing loss, if headphones  or hearing loss protection gear are not worn. Some aircrews report electric shock and minor  burns.   13.13.  Tornadoes.   13.13.1.  Tornadoes  are  violent,  rotating  columns  of  air  that  descend  from  cumulonimbus  clouds (Figure 13.13) in funnel-like or tube-like shapes. If the circulation does not reach the  surface, it is called a funnel cloud (Figure 13.14); if it touches water, it is called a waterspout  (Figure 13.15). A tornado vortex is normally several hundred yards wide but can be up to 1  \u00bd miles wide. Within the tornado\u2019s funnel-shaped circulation, winds can reach 300 miles per  hour, while the forward speed of the tornado can average 30-40 kts.     \f  154    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   Figure 13.13.  Tornado.   Figure 13.14.  Funnel Cloud.   Figure 13.15.  Waterspout.   13.13.2.  Observed  as  appendages  of  the  main  cloud,  families  of  tornadoes  or  tornadic  vortices may extend 20 miles from the lightning and precipitation areas (Figure 13.16). They  may last from a few minutes to hours. These vortices usually occur on the storm\u2019s southern         \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     155    or  south  western  flank.  Innocent  looking  cumulus  trailing  the  thunderstorm  may  mask  tornadic vortices and the vortex may not be visible to unwary aircrews. The invisible vortices  may be revealed only by swirls in the cloud base or dust whirls boiling along the ground, but  may be strong enough to cause severe structural damage to the aircraft.   Figure 13.16.  Anatomy of a Funnel Cloud.   13.13.3.  Airborne radar isn\u2019t much help in spotting tornadoes. It returns echoes of significant  precipitation  but  doesn\u2019t  display  a  spinning  column  of  air  for  your  guidance  while  flying  around  the  thunderstorms.  It  must  be  emphasized  that  just  plain  eyeballing  and  radar  scanning a line of CBs won\u2019t tell you which thunderstorm is hiding a tornado. Be cautious on  approach  and  departure,  under  or  through  lines  of  thunderstorms.  The  hazards  tend  to  increase with altitude in the clouds because of the convergence of the vortices upward in the  cloud  line.  The  effect  upon  the  aircraft  may  range  from  a  thump  to  catastrophic  airframe  failure in major encounters.   13.13.4.  Pressure  usually  falls  rapidly  with  approaching  thunderstorms,  rises  sharply  with  the onset of the  gust  front  and rain  showers, and returns to  normal  as the storm  moves on.  This pressure change cycle can occur in 15 minutes. If the altimeter setting is not corrected,  the indicated altitude may be in error by hundreds of feet.   13.14.  Identifying a Thunderstorm.   13.14.1.  Precipitation  static  is  a  steady,  high  level  of  noise  in  radio  receivers  caused  by  intense,  continual  electrical  discharges  from  sharp  metallic  points  and  edges  of  flying  aircraft.  It  is  often  encountered  in  the  vicinity  of  thunderstorms.  When  an  aircraft  flies  through  an  area  containing  clouds,  precipitation,  or  a  concentration  of  solid  particles  (ice,  sand, dust, and such), it accumulates a charge of static electricity. The electricity discharges  onto a nearby surface, or into the air, causing a noisy disturbance at lower radio frequencies.     \f  156    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   13.14.2.  Mammatus clouds (Figure 13.17) often precede severe activity, generally as a part  of the underside of the thunderstorm anvil in front of the storm. The lower-based roll cloud is  in advance of the thunderstorm and appears as a dark, ominous, boiling, cloud mass. The roll  cloud area often contains severe turbulence and signals the leading edge of the thunderstorm  gust front boundary.   Figure 13.17.  Mammatus Clouds.   13.15.  Avoiding a Thunderstorm.   13.15.1.  If conditions will not permit you to circumnavigate a thunderstorm, you have only  two alternatives; divert to the closest unaffected airfield (and wait until the storm passes) or  go  through  the  thunderstorm,  but  only  as  a  last  resort  if  required  by  your  mission.  Ask  yourself, \u2015Is going through the thunderstorm worth losing the aircraft; or my life?\u2016   13.15.2.  The  method  you  use  to  get  past  a  thunderstorm  depends  on  the  following  considerations.  Therefore,  as  you  approach  a  thunderstorm,  take  your  time  and  size  up  the  situation to ensure the method you attempt (based on the rules of thumb and the techniques  found below) will be the proper one and you won\u2019t have to do any second-guessing once you  are on your way.   13.15.3.  In estimating the situation, you must analyze the nature of the terrain, altitude of the  base  of  the  storm,  altitude  of  the  top,  number  of  storms  in  the  area  and  their  location  in  relation  to  each  other,  size  and  intensity  of  these  storms,  direction  and  velocity  of  the  movement  of  the  storm,  location  of  your  destination  and  an  alternate  airport,  and  type  of  aircraft you are flying. (Including its service ceiling and range).  WARNING: The following     \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     157    guidance is  not  to  be construed as a recommendation to  fly through, under, over, or near a  thunderstorm.  It  is  given  to  provide  information  only  in  case  your  mission  is  so  critical  to  national  defense  that  it  warrants  the  very  real  risk  of  losing  the  aircraft  and  personnel  on  board, or, as happens in some cases, you encounter a thunderstorm that is embedded in other  clouds.   13.15.4.  When you expect to fly over a storm, obtain your altitude before approaching it, so  you  are  on  top  of  the  cloud  shelf  around  the  storm  and  can  inspect  the  storm  line  before  selecting your course. A rule of thumb is to fly an additional 1,000 feet higher for every 10  knots  of  wind  speed  at  cloud  top  level.  This  rule  doesn\u2019t,  however,  guarantee  your  safety.  Remember, if the storm is in its growth stage, your altitude may not be sufficient to clear the  storm as it continues its rapid growth.   13.15.5.  The  altitude  necessary  to  fly  around  the  tops  or  over  the  saddlebacks  between  thunderstorms will vary with the season and the latitude in which you encounter the storm. In  higher latitudes (north of 60o), 25,000 feet may be sufficient, but remember the 25,000-foot"

            "text":"storm in higher latitudes can be as violent as the 50,000-foot storm close to the equator. In  the tropics, the height of the saddlebacks may be above the service ceiling of your aircraft.   13.15.6.  If  you  inadvertently  enter  a  thunderstorm,  don\u2019t  turn  around.  If  you  do,  you\u2019ll  fly  through  the  same  hazards  again.  Hold  your  original  course.  Use  your  airborne  radar  to  determine  the  shallowest  or  weakest  part  of  the  storm.  Heavy  precipitation  may  attenuate  (absorb)  your radar energy, making you believe you are safe when you are actually headed  into the most violent part of the storm.   13.15.7.  Aircrew Notes.   13.15.7.1.  Maintain turbulence-penetration airspeed before entering a thunderstorm.   13.15.7.2.  If  lightning  threatens  to  blind  you  temporarily,  turn  your  cockpit  or  thunderstorm lights to full power. Keep your eyes on the instrument panel and consider  lowering your seat.   13.15.7.3.  If St. Elmo\u2019s fire (static electricity) forms on the windshield, the wings and the  periphery of the engines, reduce your airspeed and the fire will usually go away. Always  follow flight manual procedures to maintain your flight safety margin.   13.15.7.4.  St.  Elmo\u2019s  fire  may  appear  in  various  colors  such  as  reddish  and  bluish  (reddish for a positive charge and bluish for a negative charge). It may appear outside or  even  inside  the  aircraft  as  a  small  dot  of  static  electricity  or  large  areas  of  \u201celectrical  arcing.\u201d Some pilots have even reported it as large peacock feathers arcing off the nose  of  the  aircraft.  (St.  Elmo\u2019s  fire  is  not  a  hazard  to  flight,  but  may  interfere  with  radio  communication in the form of static.) St. Elmo\u2019s fire is also a warning sign of a potential  static discharge or lightning strike.   13.15.8.  Isolated  air  mass  thunderstorms  and  orographic  thunderstorms  (those  created  by  updrafts  around  rough  terrain)  are  usually  local  and  should  be  flown  around.  The  added  mileage and time are usually of little consequence. Thunderstorms can be circumnavigated at  low,  high,  or  intermediate  levels,  depending  upon  the  set  of  circumstances  they  present.  In  any case, it is vital to determine the direction in which a line of storms is moving and to fly  between  the  storm  centers,  heading  in  at  a  right  angle.  For  individual  cells,  you  should  fly   \f  158    AFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012   with  the  rotation  of  the  storm.  Since  most  storms  rotate  counterclockwise  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere, if you are traveling eastward, fly on the south side of the storm; if you are flying  westward,  fly  on  the  north  side  of  the  storm.  Remember,  storms  generally  move  from  southwest to northeast in the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, if you are flying on the north  side of the storm, be sure to give it a wide berth to compensate for its movement.   13.15.9.  At  intermediate  levels,  keep  either  blue  sky  or  light  spots  in  the  clouds  in  sight  ahead of you. This may cause you to alter course a little from time to time to miss the storm  centers, but don\u2019t wander around. In circumnavigating at intermediate levels, it is a good plan  to stay on top of intermediate clouds where you can keep the structure of the main cloud in  view. Once you have entered the storm area, if the hole closes up ahead of you and you have  to go on instruments, don\u2019t change course. Stick to  your original right angle course and go  through. Don\u2019t alter your course on account of turbulence, rain, or hail because you may find  yourself flying through the same hazards again.   13.15.10.  If the terrain is flat or you are over the open sea, flying underneath the storm may  seem  to  be  one  of  the  easiest  ways  to  negotiate  a  thunderstorm,  but  it\u2019s  one  of  the  most  dangerous methods because of violent downdrafts, microbursts, wind shear, icing, and hail.  Familiarity  with  thunderstorm  dynamics  is  essential,  especially  where  you  will  encounter  updrafts and downdrafts (refer back to Figure 13.6). If your fuel range is short and/or your  service ceiling is low, this may be the only method open to you if your divert base is on the  other side of the storm. The \u2015Underneath\u2016 method should not be attempted in mountainous  country.   13.15.11.  If your equipment permits, fly over the top of the main body of a thunderstorm or  between  the  saddlebacks.  To  elect  this  method,  you  must  be  sure  of  your  aircraft,  sure  of  your knowledge of the storm, and sure of yourself. Remember, you should clear the top by at  least 1,000 feet of altitude for each 10 knots of wind speed at the cloud top. Flying over the  top is preferable to flying underneath; however, this may exceed the service ceiling of your  aircraft. You must know the intensity of the storm, its extent, and the direction in which it is  moving.  You  must  also  know  that  your  fuel  supply  is  adequate,  and  the  service  ceiling  of  your aircraft is sufficient to get you as high as you need to go. Some storms develop higher  than 60,000 feet in the mid-latitudes and tropics.   NOTE: Most thunderstorms build faster  than an aircraft can climb. Attempting to out-climb one can be deadly, especially since you  won\u2019t know the growth capability of the thunderstorm until  you try to \u2015race\u2016 it. Obviously  this  has  a  good  possibility  of  putting  you  into  a  dangerous  position  with  potentially  few  escape options. By flying close to the thunderstorm you are also increasing your chances of a  lightning strike or damage from hail thrown out the top of the thunderstorm.   13.15.12.  In flying over the saddlebacks or around the anvils, remember that the higher you  go, the less turbulence you will encounter. The thunderstorm anvil is created as the jet stream  shears off the top of the thunderstorm. Winds are generally strong there, and hailstones can  be  carried  as  much  as  20  miles  downstream--in  the  clear  air!  Do  not  fly  in,  under,  or  downwind of the anvil top; this is a favorite place for hailstones.   13.15.13.  If you have no alternative but to fly through a thunderstorm, try to avoid the center  of the storm or area where the most violent turbulence is apparent. Select a course where the  thunderstorm  is  visibly  least  turbulent  and  where  there  will  be  the  least  possibility  of  hail;  slow the aircraft to turbulence penetration airspeed (hopefully, you are already at this speed);   \fAFH11-203VI  12 JANUARY 2012     159    don\u2019t change course! When entering the front of a thunderstorm, you will encounter updrafts  and downdrafts. Prepare yourself by going in with enough altitude to keep from being forced  into the ground during a downdraft. Your minimum penetration altitude should be 4,000 to  6,000  feet  AGL  above  the  highest  terrain  in  the  area.  The  flight  manual  for  each  type  of  aircraft gives the correct turbulence penetration speed. In the absence of this information, a  good rule of thumb is to fly about 50 percent above stall speed. Once inside the storm, let the  plane ride out  the updrafts and downdrafts  and  concentrate on maintaining  a level  attitude.  The  attitude  gyro  is  the  primary  attitude  instrument  because  rapidly  changing  pressure  conditions  within the storm will result in  erratic variations in  altitude, airspeed, and rate of  climb,  which  cause  unreliable  readings.  Since  the  attitude  gyro  is  independent  of  the  pitot  static  system,  its  indications  should  be  considered  valid.  If  using  autopilot,  disengage  the  altitude hold mode and speed hold mode. (If used, they will increase aircraft maneuvers and  structural stress.)   WARNING: When you fly through a thunderstorm, the hazards that you  face  are  extreme.  You  will  be  betting  the  aircraft,  your  life,  and  the  lives  of  your  crew  members on the forces of nature. This must be the only remaining alternative!   13.15.14.  If you must penetrate a storm area, comply with thunderstorm avoidance rules and  follow the general flight procedures listed below:   13.15.14.1.  Don\u2019t  try  and  circumnavigate  thunderstorms  covering  6/10  or  more  of  an  area.   13.15.14.2.  Don\u2019t fly into or under the cirrus anvil. Severe hail damage can result.   13.15.14.3.  Don\u2019t  turn  around.  Attempting  to  do  so  will  keep  you  in  the  storm  longer,  increase  stress  on  the  aircraft,  increase  the  possibility  of  stall  and  may  result  in  spatial  disorientation and/or an unusual attitude.   13.15.14.4.  Don\u2019t penetrate in close formation.   13.15.14.5.  Avoid by  at  least  20 miles, any thunderstorm identified as severe or giving  an intense radar echo. This is especially true under the anvil of a large cumulonimbus.   13.15.14.6.  Get your aircraft ready for thunderstorm penetration prior to entry by setting  instrument  and  cockpit  lights  full  bright,  pitot  heat  on,  and  safety  belts  and  shoulder  harnesses tightened and locked.   13.15.14.7.  Change  power  settings  to  establish  turbulence  penetration  airspeed.  This  airspeed reduces the hazard of exceeding stress limitations.   13.15.14.8.  Choose a heading minimizing travel time in the storm.   13.15.14.9.  Try to maintain a constant attitude, but ride out the updrafts and downdrafts.  Trying to maintain an exact altitude during strong updrafts and downdrafts will increase  stress on your aircraft.  13.15.14.10.  Penetrate the storm below the freezing level or above -15oC to avoid severe  icing hazards."
